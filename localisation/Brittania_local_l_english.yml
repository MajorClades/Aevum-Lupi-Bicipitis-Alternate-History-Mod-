#####EVENTS

 britt.1.test:0 "The Harrying of the Norse"
 britt.1.desc:0 "The arrival of the eastern pagans to our shores broke the balanced state of Britannia after the Fall of Rome, steadily pushing us westward even with major comebacks.

 britt.2.test:0 "The War for the Emerald"
 britt.2.desc:0 "The island of Scotia has recently entered a state of balance, with the Scotian Kingdom raising above all other clans, but their stability can be easily toppled.

 britt.7a:0 "Picts are Christians."
 britt.7b:0 "Picts are Barbarians."

 britt.8.test:0 "The Franco-Britannic Union"
 britt.8.desc:0 "With trade from the continent flowing into the low lands of Francia and into our shores, we have made friends with the Ellanders, frankish merchants from France, or at least that's what they say they are from. Despite the riches they possess, the Ellanders have little power to defend themselves against the other continentals, some even requested us to protect them by stationing troops in their ports. We have to decide if we shall face the continental powers over their own land or let the Francine alone."

There they remained under the Soxon crown until the proclamation of New Raklion, which saw the rise of thoughts of independence in the New World.
