 britt.4.test:0 "Bryt or Brit"
 britt.4.desc:0 "The last bastion of Celtic traditions in Britannia proper defied the romans until the Northern Exodus forced us to the eastern hills.

How would we remember those that almost ravaged our beautiful island and now they stand in these halls of study, learning from what they could have destroyed. The scholarly assembly remind us that the romans were broken by many barbarians loyal only to the coin and their own, citing a more lenient approach to accept and learn from other cultures as a sure fire way to also break apart. A harder approach would however make it fairly difficult to hold many cultures under the same crown."

Despite the riches they possess, the Ellanders have little power to defend themselves against the other continentals, some even requested us to protect them by stationing troops in their ports. We have to decide if we shall face the continental powers over their own land or let the Francine alone."
