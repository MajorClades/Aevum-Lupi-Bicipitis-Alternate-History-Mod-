#####EVENTS

 britt.1.test:0 "The Dragon and the Rose"
 britt.1.desc:0 "To bring a true treasure to the dragon's den can lead to serious burns, however if the treasure is a beautiful princess, how can any men refuse the White Rose from our Jutish friends.\nThe Juts have requested an union between our two countries since the Swedish dogs set their nose in our direction and now is time to seize the ring."
 britt.1a:0 "Ask her hand in Marriage."
 britt.1b:0 "Destiny waits for no one."

 britt.2.test:0 "The Rose and the Dragon"
 britt.2.desc:0 "The Brittons have accepted our request of marriage and union between our two countries, however the Swedes have already denounced this event, they are already arming their soldiers and are ready to march upon us. But together we will stand before the Wolf and shall wear his hide as a trophy."
 britt.2a:0 "Certainly."
 britt.2b:0 "She will not be Bound."

 britt.3.test:0 "The Wolf"
 britt.3.desc:0 "A Union between Britons and Juts shall not be allowed to exist and as such we demand they to cease this proposterous celebration at once."
 britt.3a:0 "Break them."
 britt.3b:0 "Leave them."

 britt.4.test:0 "Bryt or Brit"
 britt.4.desc:0 "The last bastion of Celtic traditions in Britannia proper defied the romans until the Northern Exodus forced us to the eastern hills. While they remain a spine in our side, we must arrive to a final decision. Either we let them have a native governor with just enough autonomy to not bother us again, or crush them like all before."
 britt.4a:0 "Alea icta est."
 britt.4b:0 "They have been through enough."

 britt.5.test:0 "Curriculum Vitae"
 britt.5.desc:0 "To all those who travel the way of the scholar, the erudite and the wise, we must ask how would the future remember us? How would we remember those that almost ravaged our beautiful island and now they stand in these halls of study, learning from what they could have destroyed. The scholarly assembly remind us that the romans were broken by many barbarians loyal only to the coin and their own, citing a more lenient approach to accept and learn from other cultures as a sure fire way to also break apart. A harder approach would however make it fairly difficult to hold many cultures under the same crown."
 britt.5a:0 "Together, towards the future."
 britt.5b:0 "Britons do not forget."

 britt.100.test:0 "Island of Britain"
 britt.100.desc:0 "In the year of our Lord, 1492, a steady flow of colonists from Britannia, under Sweden's crown, departing from America, sponsored by the Soxon Emperor, arrived in the island of Britain. They named the landing site and subsequent city Riccard's Port, after the main navigator who brought them there. There they remained under the Soxon crown until the proclamation of New Raklion, which saw the rise of thoughts of independence in the New World. The newly independent Brittanians united under the Republic of New Raklion, an unique combination of Britonnic culture and Iberian ideals, creating the wealthy city of Richport."
 britt.100a:0 "Allow them on the Island."
 britt.100b:0 "Britons shall not remain free."
