How would we remember those that almost ravaged our beautiful island and now they stand in these halls of study, learning from what they could have destroyed. The scholarly assembly remind us that the romans were broken by many barbarians loyal only to the coin and their own, citing a more lenient approach to accept and learn from other cultures as a sure fire way to also break apart. A harder approach would however make it fairly difficult to hold many cultures under the same crown."

There they remained under the Soxon crown until the proclamation of New Raklion, which saw the rise of thoughts of independence in the New World. The newly independent Brittanians united under the Republic of New Raklion, an unique combination of Britonnic culture and Iberian ideals, creating the wealthy city of Richport."

Despite our combined efforts, we were both pushed westward and, under the reign of Arcturus, they pledge their loyalty to Britannian throne. Unfortunately constant wars with Sweden have eroded that loyalty, but now we can restore this ancient fellowship."
