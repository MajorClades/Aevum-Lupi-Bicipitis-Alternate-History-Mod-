#####EVENTS
 voga.1.test:0 "Heaven Paid In Gold"
 voga.1.desc:0 "The people of Vogadia have faith: in the republic, in the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and God.\nHow to express that faith changes town by town, each village with its own flavor.\nThe Republic, however, must make a calculated choice to obtain the support of greater nations. The Lucanian church has proven to be stronger than the Impotian Emperor but the Pope is distant and the Impotians are awfully close."
 voga.1a:0 "The Pope is Weak!"
 voga.1b:0 "Soxony is going to Collapse!"

 voga.2.test:0 "Glory to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]"
 voga.2.desc:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName],the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has gathered [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] council and the proposals for the future of Vogadia are now being discussed. There are many who hold great power in the countryside who demand to have a voice in the Republic dealings, but there are many ways to give them what they want."
 voga.2a:0 "I shall make Nobles out of you!"
 voga.2b:0 "All votes are Equal and yours is more Equal than others."
 voga.2c:0 "Heaven holds your reward."

 voga.3.test:0 "The Fall of Violence"
 voga.3.desc:0 "The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has been captured by an angry mob of peasants and they will not release the captive until their demands are met.\nDisband the private mercenaries and allow proper elections to take hold in Vogadia. For the time being the only real stable power is in the hands of the few clergymen that respond to foreign nations, but their involvement is higly unlikely."
 voga.3a:0 "What are Elections if they are not rigged?"
 voga.3b:0 "The Peasantry is free once more!"
 voga.3c:0 "The Balance of Power shifts drastically."

 voga.4.test:0 "The State of the Army"
 voga.4.desc:0 "As Iberia is slowly coming under our powerful army, which may finally need to be arranged to proper standard if we want to deal with the bigger players in the continent. A mercenary support to a national army may be what is expected, but some are wary of the loyalty to the coin rather then the state."
 voga.4a:0 "The Army belongs to the Coin."
 voga.4b:0 "The Army belongs to the State."

 voga.5.test:0 "The General and the Peasant"
 voga.5.desc:0 "Captain of the Argentine Company Juan Castillo took control of Vogadia in 1399 when the Republic hired him to keep the border secure from Burgundian and Spaniard raids.\nConsidering the sorry state the Vogadian militia was at the time, it was not a surprise when the Dictatorship was declared later that year. Juan has governed the Republic for 45 long years and..."
 voga.5a:0 "He ruled with an Iron Fist."
 voga.5b:0 "He saved Vogadia from Subjugation."

 voga.6.test:0 "Murder He Wrought"
 voga.6.desc:0 "The world of mercenary companies is a cutthroat one but this time it comes with the strenght of a man born to kill.\nCorvus has rallied plenty of soldier at his side through legendary deeds but the oppurtunity to sieze power appeared only now. He and his men are holding siege to the palace of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] but it's only a matter of time before the palace breaks."
 voga.6a:0 "Give Him the Role."
 voga.6b:0 "Send a message to the people!"
