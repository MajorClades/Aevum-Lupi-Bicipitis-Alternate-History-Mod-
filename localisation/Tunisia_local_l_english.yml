Already tensions are rising between the Catholics and Indictians in our nation, as they blame each other for the disastrous fire. The situation needs to be urgently brought under control lest our nation be torn apart."

 cr_build_army_title:0 "Defend the City"
 cr_build_army_desc:0 "[341.GetName], our capital, lacks the defences one would expect from a city of its size. Membership in the Holy Italian Empire ensures protection from the sea, but not the land. The African statelets and the Amazigh tribesmen launch frequent raids on our land. Let us build up our military forces. The best defense is a good offense, after all."

 cr_crush_aldabba_desc:0 "Aldabba, the throne of the Southern Roman empire, has been contested for long. We are simply the latest to rule in this city. But we shall not be like the others, for we have no pretensions of claiming the Southern empire. The African peoples shall simply be one among many in our realm. [336.GetName] will be nothing more than a provincial centre. Let the dream of Aldabba sleep forevermore."

By restoring the magnificence of this great city, we can bring the entire Western Mediterranean under our naval control."

 cr_african_campaign_complete_title:0 "Africa's Rightful Ruler"
 cr_african_campaign_complete_desc:0 "The game of thrones is over. Aldabba, vanquished. Nundia, crushed. Libia, subjugated. The rest, brought to heel. It is only fair for us to add the title of lord of Africa to the many others we possess."

 cr_steal_western_islands_title:0 "Sardinian Adventures"

 cr_mercmaxxing_title:0 "Invite Foreign Mercenaries"
 cr_mercmaxxing_desc:0 "Ancient Carthage was never too great of a land power. One primary reason was the lack of native manpower, an issue that afflicts us as well. Let us make use of mercenaries and auxiliary forces like them."

 cr_med_trade_hegemon_title:0 "Trade Hegemon"
 cr_med_trade_hegemon_desc:0 "We have finally matched the ancient Carthaginians in influence across the sea. From Constantinople to Cartagena our vessels ply the waves. All the trade of Southern Europe and Africa flows through us. Carthge is a centre of world trade once more."

 cr0_carthaginian_nation_title:0 "Carthaginian Nation"
 cr0_carthaginian_nation_desc:0 "The coup has succeeded. But our realm continues to face a great religious divide, and this new republic is seen as illegitimate by many. There exists a solution, of course-let us unite our people and build faith in the new government by hearkening back to the ancient realm that based itself here; one that challenged Rome itself at the height of it's might. Let the legacy of Dido be revived."

 cr0_religious_question_title:0 "The Religious Question"

 cr0_invite_jewish_scholars_desc:0 "In our efforts to create a new identity around which to bind our people, a startling discovery has been made. It turns out that the old Phoenician tongue, while it may be gone, does have a close surviving relative-Hebrew. It would be wise to invite learned Jews to our court so that we may decipher the Punic tongue with their aid."

 cr0_punic_revival_title:0 "The Punic Revival"
 cr0_punic_revival_desc:0 "Our efforts at creating a new Punic identity have borne fruit surpassing our expectations. Since the translation of Punic, it has become fashionable among many to speak it in daily life. Even the commoners have been doing so. It seems that the Punic culture has been reborn in the modern age."

 cr0_spread_new_identity_title:0 "Spread Our New Identity"
 cr0_spread_new_identity_desc:0 "We are masters of Africa. Our people now speak the ancient tongue of Qart-Hadasht. Let us wholeheartedly spread our new tongue and culture across the land. Catholic, Indictian- it doesn't matter. We are all Punics!"

 cr1_novo_italia_title:0 "A New Italia"
 cr1_novo_italia_desc:0 "Our efforts have been successful. Tunisia now rules over a truly Catholic Africa. The Africans have been eagerly adopting our superior Italian civilization. It would be fair to say that we are now an Italy across the sea-a §PNovo Italia§!"

 cr_land_in_iberia_desc:0 "The greatest challenge to our control of the sea remain the nations of Iberia. In control of the Pillars of Hercules and some of the greatest ports of the west, we must subjugate them if we seek to cement our authority as masters of the Mediterranean."

 carto.1.test:0 "The Great Fire of [341.GetName]"
 carto.1.desc:0 "A tragedy has struck [341.GetName] as an unfortunate warehouse accident caused a fire to spiral out of control, leading to a raging inferno engulfing the city! It burned the whole day, and resulted in the destruction of most of the city's buildings, leaving our nation now economically destitute. The fire has lead to increased tension between the Catholics and Indictians in our nation, as they blame each other for the disastrous fire. This event shall shape our nation for years to come, and time will tell what comes of this."
 carto.1a:0 "Oh no!"

 carto.2.test:0 "Trial of Faith"
 carto.2.desc:0 "It's unclear how exactly the fire started. While many are quick to blame the Indictians, the truth is that the clerical tension has reached a boiling point that necessitates a direct order from the king. The local leader of the Indictian clergy has petitioned the court to create a trial for the possible suspects, claiming to have found the arsonist but demanding a fair judgement. On the other side, the Imperial Envoy has urged the complete conversion of the populace to the Lucanian Church; otherwise, the Emperor may reconsider our Electorate position. The choice is not one taken lightly. Consider the options, my liege."
 carto.2a:0 "Crack down on the infidels."
 carto.2b:0 "Set up a proper trial."

 carto.3.test:0 "Mercy of the Clergy"
 carto.3.desc:0 "The Lucanian Church has sent the court an envoy.\n'Cease the senseless oppression of our brethren in faith!'\nThe cost of proper governance with the Indictians and the Catholics have taken a toll on the population, leading many to simply leave for more tolerant countries; however, we are just in time to mend our action and mercifully reinstate the heretics."
 carto.3a:0 "Mercy is for the true faithful."
 carto.3b:0 "Assume the burden of apology."

 carto.4.test:0 "Trials and Tribulations"
 carto.4.desc:0 "During the trial, standing in front of the King, instead of a chained miscreant, a mob of Indictian men and African agitators has gathered and overwhelmed the royal guards.\nAlthough the King has been captured and the news has reached the shores, only a few nobles have raised their levies and prepared an attack against us.\nThey will see the might of Carthage, returned from the ashes of the sea and the spirit of it's people!"
 carto.4a:0 "Carthago Revertitura!"

 carto.5.test:0 "Reborn in Flame"
 carto.5.desc:0 "As the people run through the streets of the city, the Indictian clergy takes charge of organising the resistance and the war against the old nobles.\nEventually the clergy will mediate the various factions that remain in the country, consolidating the institutions into the new Carthaginian Republic."
 carto.5a:0 "The Republic Reborn in Flames."

 carto.6.test:0 "A Question of Faith"
 carto.6.desc:0 "The Indictian clergy was the driving force behind the restoration of Carthage. However, there is still a sizeable Catholic minority that wishes we return to our roots and embrace Catholicism once again."
 carto.6a:0 "Forgive me father, for I have sinned."
 carto.6b:0 "The Indictian faith suits us fine."

 carto.8.test:0 "Rex Africanus"
 carto.8.desc:0 "From the Sahara to the Mediterranean, all tribes, lords, baucadux and monasteries bow down to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]. However, they do not rule as the old emperors of Africa once did. Indictianism is rooted out and replaced with [Root.Religion.GetName], and the old capital of Aldabba is relegated to a mere provincial city. From [Root.Capital.GetName] swears fealty, and they shall stary subjects forevermore."
 carto.8a:0 "The dream of Africa, no more."

 carto.9.test:0 "The Expedition to Cirta"
 carto.9.desc:0 "To begin reviving a language, you must have something to start with. And after reports of a cemetery, complete with inscriptions in both Latin and Punic, came to our attention, we had to investigate. Lo and behold, after years of work, we have compiled a near complete compendium of all Punic texts we could gather."
 carto.9a:0 "A wonderful basis to start from."

 carto.10.test:0 "Translation of the Punic Language"
 carto.10.desc:0 "Finally, we have successfully translated all of the texts we have gathered. All that is left is to compile it."
 carto.10a:0 "Splendid!"

 carto.11.test:0 "The First Punic Dictionary"
 carto.11.desc:0 "After multiple grueling years of work the first Punic dictionary is complete. It serves as a complete resource for anyone to be able to learn Punic from, and shall be invaluable for our revival efforts."
 carto.11a:0 "Splendid!"

 carto.12.test:0 "The Education of the Court"
 carto.12.desc:0 "Our efforts to educate the men and women of our court in the Punic language is a success! Instead of Latin or Italian, the true language of Carthage is spoken in royal halls, providing plenty of prestige."
 carto.12a:0 "Splendid!"

 carto.13.test:0 "A Punic Realm"
 carto.13.desc:0 "Rejoice! Our efforts have paid off! For now we may not just call ourselves pretenders to Carthage, but actual Carthaginians, for we have fully revived the culture and langaueg of the ancients!"
