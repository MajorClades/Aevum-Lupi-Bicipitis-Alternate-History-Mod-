 carto.1.test:0 "The Great Fire of [341.GetName]"
 carto.1.desc:0 "A tragedy has struck [341.GetName] as an unfortunate warehouse accident caused a fire to spiral out of control, leading to a raging inferno engulfing the city! It burned the whole day, and resulted in the destruction of most of the city's buildings, leaving our nation now economically destitute. The fire has lead to increased tension between the Catholics and Indictians in our nation, as they blame each other for the disastrous fire. This event shall shape our nation for years to come, and time will tell what comes of this."
 carto.1a:0 "Oh no!"

 carto.2.test:0 "Trial of Faith"
 carto.2.desc:0 "It's unclear how exactly the fire started. While many are quick to blame the Indictians, the truth is that the clerical tension has reached a boiling point that necessitates a direct order from the king. The local leader of the Indictian clergy has petitioned the court to create a trial for the possible suspects, claiming to have found the arsonist but demanding a fair judgement. On the other side, the Imperial Envoy has urged the complete conversion of the populace to the Lucanian Church; otherwise, the Emperor may reconsider our Electorate position. The choice is not one taken lightly. Consider the options, my liege."
 carto.2a:0 "Crack down on the infidels."
 carto.2b:0 "Set up a proper trial."

 carto.3.test:0 "Mercy of the Clergy"
 carto.3.desc:0 "The Lucanian Church has sent the court an envoy.\n'Cease the senseless oppression of our brethren in faith!'\nThe cost of proper governance with the Indictians and the Catholics have taken a toll on the population, leading many to simply leave for more tolerant countries; however, we are just in time to mend our action and mercifully reinstate the heretics."
 carto.3a:0 "Mercy is for the true faithful."
 carto.3b:0 "Assume the burden of apology."

 carto.4.test:0 "Trials and Tribulations"
 carto.4.desc:0 "During the trial, standing in front of the King, instead of a chained miscreant, a mob of Indictian men and African agitators has gathered and overwhelmed the royal guards.\nAlthough the King has been captured and the news has reached the shores, only a few nobles have raised their levies and prepared an attack against us.\nThey will see the might of Carthage, returned from the ashes of the sea and the spirit of it's people!"
 carto.4a:0 "Carthago Revertitura!"

 carto.5.test:0 "Reborn in Flame"
 carto.5.desc:0 "As the people run through the streets of the city, the Indictian clergy takes charge of organising the resistance and the war against the old nobles.\nEventually the clergy will mediate the various factions that remain in the country, consolidating the institutions into the new Carthaginian Republic."
 carto.5a:0 "The Republic Reborn in Flames."

 carto.6.test:0 "A Question of Faith"
 carto.6.desc:0 "The Indictian clergy was the driving force behind the restoration of Carthage. However, there is still a sizeable Catholic minority that wishes we return to our roots and embrace Catholicism once again."
 carto.6a:0 "Forgive me father, for I have sinned."
 carto.6b:0 "The Indictian faith suits us fine."

 carto.8.test:0 "Rex Africanus"
 carto.8.desc:0 "From the Sahara to the Mediterranean, all tribes, lords, baucadux and monasteries bow down to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]. However, they do not rule as the old emperors of Africa once did. Indictianism is rooted out and replaced with [Root.Religion.GetName], and the old capital of Aldabba is relegated to a mere provincial city. From [Root.Capital.GetName] swears fealty, and they shall stary subjects forevermore."
 carto.8a:0 "The dream of Africa, no more."

 carto.9.test:0 "The Expedition to Cirta"
 carto.9.desc:0 "To begin reviving a language, you must have something to start with. And after reports of a cemetery, complete with inscriptions in both Latin and Punic, came to our attention, we had to investigate. Lo and behold, after years of work, we have compiled a near complete compendium of all Punic texts we could gather."
 carto.9a:0 "A wonderful basis to start from."

 carto.10.test:0 "Translation of the Punic Language"
 carto.10.desc:0 "Finally, we have successfully translated all of the texts we have gathered. All that is left is to compile it."
 carto.10a:0 "Splendid!"

 carto.11.test:0 "The First Punic Dictionary"
 carto.11.desc:0 "After multiple grueling years of work the first Punic dictionary is complete. It serves as a complete resource for anyone to be able to learn Punic from, and shall be invaluable for our revival efforts."
 carto.11a:0 "Splendid!"

 carto.12.test:0 "The Education of the Court"
 carto.12.desc:0 "Our efforts to educate the men and women of our court in the Punic language is a success! Instead of Latin or Italian, the true language of Carthage is spoken in royal halls, providing plenty of prestige."
 carto.12a:0 "Splendid!"

 carto.13.test:0 "A Punic Realm"
 carto.13.desc:0 "Rejoice! Our efforts have paid off! For now we may not just call ourselves pretenders to Carthage, but actual Carthaginians, for we have fully revived the culture and langaueg of the ancients!"
 carto.13a:0 "We are truly the heirs of Carthage!"

 carto.7.test:0 "An Offer From Our Neighbor"
 carto.7.desc:0 "The country of Tunisia offers us a gentle request of subjugation, refusal is allowed and the offers will forever be rescinded."
 carto.7a:0 "And we shall gladly accept."
 carto.7b:0 "Bipoli stands alone!"
