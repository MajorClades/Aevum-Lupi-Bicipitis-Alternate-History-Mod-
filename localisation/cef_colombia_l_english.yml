 CEF_flavor_col.1.desc:0 "The Southern Expedition, undertaken by the first New Granada settlers, was a pivotal journey that aimed to expand Spanish colonial influence into the southern regions of the continent. Led by Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada in the mid-16th century, the expedition ventured southward from the Caribbean coast, traversing the challenging terrain of the Andes mountains and dense jungles. Enduring hardships, battles with indigenous peoples, and disease, the expedition eventually reached the high plateau of the Altiplano Cundiboyacense, where they encountered the rich civilizations of the Muisca people. This encounter marked the beginning of Spanish colonization in the region."

 CEF_flavor_col.2.desc:0 "The Western Expedition, also known as the "Road to El Dorado," was a significant journey undertaken by the first New Granada settlers in the 16th century. Led by Sebastián de Belalcázar, the expedition ventured westward from the Andean highlands of present-day Colombia into the dense jungles and rugged terrain of what is now Ecuador and Peru. Motivated by tales of gold and riches, the expedition aimed to discover the legendary city of El Dorado. Despite facing numerous challenges such as harsh climates, hostile indigenous tribes, and treacherous landscapes, the expedition made significant advances, ultimately contributing to the Spanish colonization of the region and the exploration of South America."

Departing from the northern Andean region of present-day Colombia, the expedition ventured eastward across the vast plains and dense jungles of the Llanos Orientales, aiming to explore and conquer the uncharted territories of the Orinoco River basin. Enduring hardships such as extreme weather, disease, and encounters with indigenous tribes, the expedition eventually reached the Orinoco River, contributing to the Spanish discovery and colonization of the vast hinterlands of South America."

 CEF_flavor_col.4.title:0 "Viceroyalty of New Granada"
 CEF_flavor_col.4.desc:0 "The Viceroyalty of New Granada was a colonial administrative division of the Spanish Empire that encompassed much of northern South America. Established in 1717, it was one of the most important and influential territories in the Spanish American empire. Under the Viceroyalty of New Granada, Spanish colonial authorities exerted control over the region, implementing policies aimed at exploiting its rich natural resources, particularly gold and silver, and establishing a network of settlements, missions, and trade routes. The Viceroyalty of New Granada played a significant role in the economic, social, and cultural development of the region. It served as a center for colonial administration, commerce, and religious activities, with major cities such as Bogotá, Quito, and Cartagena becoming important hubs of political power, trade, and culture."

 CEF_flavor_col.5.title:0 "Legitimacy Questioned"
 CEF_flavor_col.5.desc:0 "The questioned legitimacy of the king served as a rallying point for independence movements in Spanish America due to the complex interplay of historical events and socio-political factors. The Peninsular War and Napoleonic invasion shook the foundation of Spanish authority, leading to uncertainty and upheaval in the colonies. With the imprisonment of Ferdinand VII, colonial authorities lacked clear leadership, prompting local elites to question the legitimacy of Spanish rule and assert their own claims to sovereignty. Moreover, the lack of representation in Spanish political institutions left colonial elites feeling marginalized and excluded from the decision-making processes that affected their lives. The Enlightenment ideals of liberty and self-determination also inspired revolutionary leaders to challenge Spanish rule and advocate for independence."

 CEF_flavor_col.6.title:0 "Panama Independence Movement"
 CEF_flavor_col.6.desc:0 "In the colonial era, the Panama Independence Movement gained traction as part of the broader struggles for independence sweeping across Latin America. Gran Colombia, established in 1819 by Simón Bolívar, encompassed present-day Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, and Panama. However, tensions between Panama and the central government in Bogotá, coupled with geopolitical interests, eventually led to Panama's quest for independence. One of the key factors driving the Panama Independence Movement was the desire for greater autonomy and representation within Gran Colombia. Panamanian elites, feeling marginalized and neglected by the central government, sought greater political and economic control over their region. Additionally, Panama's strategic location as a transit point between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans heightened its importance and fueled aspirations for independence."

 CEF_flavor_col.8.desc:0 "The centralization of Gran Colombia was a pivotal aspect of its governance, reflecting the visionary leadership of Simón Bolívar and his commitment to creating a unified and powerful nation in northern South America. Its centralization efforts aimed to consolidate authority, promote stability, and foster national unity. Under Bolívar's leadership, Gran Colombia adopted a centralized system of government with a strong executive branch based in the capital $CAPITAL$. Bolívar wielded considerable influence over the central government, allowing for swift decision-making and effective implementation of policies. This centralized authority extended to the military, where Bolívar's command ensured unity of purpose and coordinated efforts to defend against internal and external threats. Economically, Gran Colombia pursued centralized policies to promote economic integration and development across its territory. Standardized currency, trade regulations, and infrastructure projects facilitated commerce and transportation, fostering economic growth and prosperity."

 CEF_flavor_col.9.title:0 "Gran Colombia Shattered"
 CEF_flavor_col.9.desc:0 "The shattering of Gran Colombia was the culmination of longstanding internal tensions and external pressures that ultimately fractured the ambitious union envisioned by Simón Bolívar. Internal divisions between centralists and federalists, exacerbated by regional rivalries and economic disparities, eroded the cohesion of Gran Colombia and hindered effective governance. Simultaneously, the absence of Bolívar's charismatic leadership and the emergence of new geopolitical realities in Latin America contributed to the dissolution of the union."
 CEF_flavor_col.9.a:0 "A state too expensive in itself, or by virtue of its dependencies, ultimately falls into decay."
 CEF_flavor_col.10.title:0 "Simón Bolívar"
 CEF_flavor_col.10.desc:0 "Simón Bolívar, often referred to as "The Liberator," was a towering figure in the struggle for independence in Latin America during the early 19th century. Born in Venezuela in 1783, Bolívar dedicated his life to liberating South America from Spanish colonial rule and achieving the dream of a united and independent continent. Bolívar's military genius and strategic vision played a pivotal role in the liberation of present-day Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia from Spanish control. His bold campaigns, including the famous crossing of the Andes Mountains, secured crucial victories that paved the way for independence. Beyond his military achievements, Bolívar was a visionary statesman who sought to establish republican governments based on principles of democracy, freedom, and equality. He played a central role in the creation of Gran Colombia and advocated for the unity of Latin American nations."

 CEF_flavor_col.11.desc:0 "Simón Bolívar, the iconic leader of Latin American independence movements, died on December 17, 1830, at the age of 47. His death occurred in Santa Marta, Colombia, where he had retreated after resigning from the presidency of Gran Colombia earlier that year. Bolívar's health had been deteriorating, likely due to tuberculosis, and he was physically and emotionally exhausted from years of struggle and political turmoil. Despite his declining health, Bolívar remained committed to the cause of Latin American unity and independence until the end. His death marked the end of an era and left a profound impact on the nascent republics he had helped to establish. Bolívar's passing sparked widespread mourning across Latin America and beyond, as people mourned the loss of the revered leader who had dedicated his life to the liberation of his homeland and the pursuit of freedom and justice for all."

 CEF_flavor_col.12.title:0 "Region Demands Autonomy"
 CEF_flavor_col.12.desc:0 "The demands for autonomy in Gran Colombia stemmed from various factors, including regional identities, political grievances, and economic disparities. Despite Simón Bolívar's vision of a unified and powerful nation encompassing present-day Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, and Panama, tensions arose within the federation over the extent of central authority and regional autonomy. Regional identities played a significant role in driving demands for autonomy. Each region within Gran Colombia had its own distinct history, culture, and economic interests, leading to a sense of attachment and loyalty to local identities. Political grievances also fueled demands for autonomy. Centralists, who supported a strong central government, clashed with federalists, who advocated for greater power and autonomy for regional governments. This ideological divide led to political instability and gridlock within Gran Colombia's legislative bodies, hindering effective governance."
