 kormongol.0.t:0 "A Crumbling Khanate"
 kormongol.0.d:0 "Solongun history began following the Great Barbarian Revolt against the Empire of 10,000 Armies in 1263. The Eljigid, Khongiraf, Olkhunud, and Jalayirid tribes rose in revolt against the tyrannical rule of Guo Hong. They were crushed within two years, and Bodi Jalayirid was executed. His son, Dayan, was forced to lead the clans into exile. They sought refuge in Korea, hoping the King of Goryeo would take pity on them. He viewed their arrival as an invasion and moved to kill them. Unfortunately for him, he overestimated the strength of his army and was killed in battle. Goryeo disintegrated and the tribes soon took over the majority of Korea. Dayan the Great was made Khan of Solongos in 1267, beginning a golden age that lasted until the invasion of Korea by the Yan Dynasty in 1310. Dayan's son, Buyan the Coward, held delusions of grandeur not seen since ancient times. These delusions led him to reject the Yan Dynasty's demand for tribute, and 50,000 Chinese soldiers subsequently invaded the penninsula. They only left in 1312 when Buyan kowtowed before Emperor Xiaolou Bu and agreed to pay tribute. Ever since the Solongun Khanate has essentially existed in name only. The other tribes swore fealty to each new Khan, but were free to act essentially as they pleased. The only thing that has kept them in line has been the skill and cruelty of the Jalayirids. Unfortunately, time is quickly running out for the Khanate. Adai Taiji has been an excellent ruler and has kept the other tribes in line for decades, but his son Oyiradai is weak. Ineffectual. He spends far more time with his sisters in the palace than with his brothers hunting. When Adai Taiji dies, it is likely the Solongun Khanate will die with him."
 kormongol.0a:0 "The situation is bleak."

 kormongol.1.t:0 "A Crumbling Khanate"
 kormongol.1.d:0 "When Dayan the Great led us to this land, it was said to be a santuaryy. A place where we would be safe from the persecution of the Chinese, where we would be able to build a home for our families in peace. Dayan delivered on that promise. Buyan let us be invaded by the Chinese. His successors have continued to pay tribute to dying Yan dynasty, while forcing us to pay tribute to them all the same. It is clear to everyone that we have lived under the boots of the Jalayirids for too long. Unfortunately, Adai Taiji has proven himself more than willing to put down any attempts at freedom from their clutches. Fortunately, Adai Taiji is old. Weak. He will die soon. And then we will seize our freedom."
 kormongol.1a:0 "It is only a matter of time."

 kormongol.2.t:0 "The Death of Adai Taiji Jalair"
 kormongol.2.d:0 "Tragedy has struck the Jalayirid Clan. Adai Taiji, Khan of the Solonguns, has passed away. He managed to save our Khanate from certain destruction time and time again, keeping the other clans in line when lesser men would have backed down. Now his son Oyiradai must take up the mantle of Khan. The other clans have already made their position on him quite clear. They will not recognise him as their Khan. They have already begun making preparations for independence from our rule. It seems the Khanate of Dayan the Great has at last come to an end."
 kormongol.2a:0 "Cut our losses and let the bastards go. We'll be back."
 kormongol.2b:0 "Who do they think they are? Who do they think we are? They will fall in line!"

 kormongol.3.t:0 "The End of the Solongun Khanate"
 kormongol.3.d:0 "Adai Taiji is dead. The Jalayirids, understanding that his pathetic excuse for an heir would be no good as Khan, have accepted the reality of the situation with what little dignity they have remaining. They no longer require us to pay tribute to them. Our people can finally breath freely, for the first time since our subjugation by the Dragon Emperor."
 kormongol.3a:0 "It's about time!"

 kormongol.4.t:0 "The Jalayirids stand firm"
 kormongol.4.d:0 "Adai Taiji is dead. In any sane society, the Jalayirids would understand that Oyiradai is not fit to be Khan and would allow the clans to go their separate ways. As it turns out, the Jalayirids are not a sane society. Oyiradai has refused to allow us our long awaited independence, instead insisting that we remain subjects of a Khanate that has not meaningfully existed for a century. This injustice will not be forgotten."
 kormongol.4a:0 "How dare they!"

 kormongol.5.t:0 "The Future of the Khanate"
 kormongol.5.d:0 "With the restoration of Dayan the Great's Khanate, we have arrived at a crossroads. In the time since the Yan invasion, many of the once nomadic communities have begun settling down and assimilating into the local Korean communities. Shall we stay true to our roots, or embrace our new home?"
 kormongol.5a:0 "In Dayan's name, we ride once more!"
 kormongol.5b:0 "The time of conquerors is over."
