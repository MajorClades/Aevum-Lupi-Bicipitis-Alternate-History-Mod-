 #Is also shared by Wycliffian
 AEVUM_orthodox_flavor.1.d: "The Church has historically been a large landowner, and this has brought a great deal of wealth to the Church, something that has led to much debate in the Christian world. The Catholics with the Papacy in Rome argue that the Church needs this wealth to carry out its holy mission. The Impotians and Wycliffians, however, cite the Cleansing of the Temple by Jesus as a clear sign that the church shall not get corrupted by earthly and material possessions, and will instead keep their temples cleansed of sin."
 AEVUM_orthodox_flavor.1.a: "Corruption and Sin in the church must be prevented."
 AEVUM_orthodox_flavor.1.b: "Jesus preached about simony, he never mentioned land-ownership."


 AEVUM_orthodox_flavor.2.t: "A Great Assembly" #Synod = Synodus = Assembly/Meeting
 AEVUM_orthodox_flavor.2.d: "The Patriarchs, Priests, and Theologians has gathered in a great assembly, they are asking for your support and certain privileges in return for helping fight anti-feudal heresies that are stalking our land. Do we help the Church keep the people in their place or do we support these movements to break up the old Feudal order."


 AEVUM_orthodox_flavor.3.d: "The [Root.Religion.GetName] Church is the One, Holy, Christian, and true disciple of Jesus Christ our lord and his apostles. However, our family is large and diverse. Our theologian is proposing some reforms to our liturgy that will bring our form closer to the other churches. The idea is bold and might mend some relations but is bending ourselves and our true faith to please others a worthy endeavour."
 AEVUM_orthodox_flavor.3.tt: "Every Christian neighbour that isn't §Y[Root.Religion.GetName]§! will receive §G+20§! Opinion with @[Root.GetTag] §Y[Root.GetName]§!"

 #Vanilla Orthodox Icons replacements:
 AEVUM_orthodox_icon_events.1.t: "Jesus the Farmer" #Jesus farming, not much else. A connection with the common folk, their hardships and plights (especially as this icon would be prayed to avoid plague and for good harvests)
 AEVUM_orthodox_icon_events.1.d: "Mourning the loss of both his entire family and his countryside farm a man from the war-torn province of [eleusa_church_province.GetName] reportedly spent a day and a night praying before the grand icon depicting Jesus farming in the [eleusa_church_province.GetCapitalName] cathedral. As the city itself was under occupation his sorrow was shared by many of his [Root.GetAdjective] brethren. The very next day it was as if the painting had heard his prayers. The loyal people of [eleusa_church_province.GetName] rose as one and evicted the remaining enemy forces.\nThe continued fortunes of the province seem unclear but as war and devastation haunt the [Root.GetAdjective] countryside many of our citizens are turning to the church for consolation and moral support."

 AEVUM_orthodox_icon_events.3.t: "Jesus the Bright and Morning-Star" # 'I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and morning star' A play on words since morningstar is also a type of medieaval weapon = war against evil and sin
 AEVUM_orthodox_icon_events.3.d: "A recent recruitment campaign in [michael_icon_church_province.GetName] has given rise to an unprecedented number of new recruits enlisting. The local clergy is convinced that this was the result of the widespread religious fervor that our icon and depiction of Jesus Cleansing the Temple has inspired. They report that young men have been coming from all parts of the area to see the icon of the Messias and that they leave with a strong will to go to war in the name of their undying and loyal faith to cleanse the world of sin."

 AEVUM_orthodox_icon_events.4.t: "Jesus the Carpenter" # Jesus was outside of his work as a preacher, also a carpenter, helping to create houses and other buildings. This must be an inspiration for the various craftsmen, masons and architects of the time as they all look up to the Creator of All.
 AEVUM_orthodox_icon_events.4.d: "As the ruler of all, Jesus Christ watches from above, in many of the church-domes around the country. We must not forget that besides being the True Messiah, Jesus was also a carpeneter, venerating and creating works of art as well as houses of lumber and stone. Our veneration and extensive attention to this most central ideal of building seem to have been the source of contemplation for many. Reminded of their own role in creation and of the rightful place of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] many are more content with both their own lives and with the government that rules them"
 AEVUM_orthodox_icon_events.4.a: "For the kingdom we create is His."


 AEVUM_orthodox_icon_events.5.t: "The three gifts of Jesus" # Jesus 'gifted' his blood and flesh during the last supper.
 AEVUM_orthodox_icon_events.5.d: "Our veneration of Jesus at Supper seems to have made quite an impression on one of the merchants in a recent embassy from [benevolent_if_distant_neighbor.GetName]. The merchant was so impressed by the depiction in [nicholas_icon_was_here.GetCapitalName], by the story of the gift hos His own flesh and blood, and by our devotion to His legacy of goodwill and generosity, that he decided to bestow three gifts. One gift will go to the cathedral where he saw the icon, one to the artist who created it and one to the benefactor who paid for it."


 AEVUM_orthodox_icon_events.6.t: "Jesus the Fisherman"
 AEVUM_orthodox_icon_events.6.d: "The clergy of [climacus_church_province.GetCapitalName] cathedral claim that it is thanks to the strong local veneration of Jesus the Fishermen, and the example he set for undaunting bravery, stout belief and absolute faith that the entire province now blossoms so. Indeed, fishermen return from the seas with more plentiful catch, and the people more at peace and loyal than ever before. The 'Fisherman' has helped many to brave the oceans themselves over the centuries and now we seem once again to be in His debt."
 AEVUM_orthodox_icon_events.6.b: "And by your devotion for God you brought forth fish in abundance."


 #Vanilla Orthodox Patriarchs replacement:
 AEVUM_patriarch_events.1.t: "The Depictions of [local_saint_state_province.GetAreaName]"
 AEVUM_patriarch_events.1.d: "There is great uncertainty in the see of [local_saint_state_province.GetAreaName]. While we are united in faith the people of the state, including many of the local priests, are refusing to participate in the feasts and celebrations of depictions of Christ that are customary within our borders. They claim that these are not canonical and that they will observe the religious customs of their own depictions, including the veneration of a number of suspect paintings not legally recognised by our Patriarch from the area."

 AEVUM_patriarch_events.2.t: "Clerical Poverty"
 AEVUM_patriarch_events.2.d: "The bishop of [local_see_province.GetAreaName] has objected to [Root.Monarch.GetName] and the aggravating way [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has stripped the belongings of the Cathedral in [local_see_province.GetCapitalName]. While he insists he is not ungrateful for the great life and holy path the Bishop has been given, he is now questioning the repossessng of the Churches riches to further the interests of the [Root.GovernmentName]."
 AEVUM_patriarch_events.2.b: "Maybe we can return some of their church silver."


 AEVUM_patriarch_events.3.b: "We will repair the building, but don't expect any excess."


 AEVUM_patriarch_events.4.d: "Our newly appointed Metropolitan of [judaizers_province.GetAreaName] has uncovered a horrifying local heresy. He claims that the sect is denouncing the Trinity, iconoclastic depictions and even the divinity of Jesus Christ. The Metropolitan has asked us to help him in this time of need as he will require many more resources to root out this heresy which is widespread among high as well as low.\nThe case seems very clear. Except it seems the sect has some supporters even in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]. Can we really afford to lose the support of these men and women and are they really as heretic as the Metropolitan claims?"


 AEVUM_patriarch_events.5.d: "The Bishop of [monastic_province.GetAreaName] reports that the local monastic communities are growing at an unprecedented speed. The Estates of a local monastery in [monastic_province.GetCapitalName] have in fact grown so big and are so well kept that they have become the envy of our local administrator. The governor has become entangled in a conflict with the Monks over where exactly the demarcation between their lands and those of the [Root.GovernmentName] goes.\nThe time has come for central authorities to step in and settle the dispute. Helping the monastery would undoubtedly secure their gratitude, but this could also be an opportunity to get hold of more land for the state, and even be justification to punish the Monks for being in breach of Clerical Poverty..."
 AEVUM_patriarch_events.5.a: "Our Governor is clearly right, correct this immediately."
 AEVUM_patriarch_events.5.c: "The monks are clearly in breach of Clerical Poverty, confiscate their estate!"
