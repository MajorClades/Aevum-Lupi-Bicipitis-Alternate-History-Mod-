#EVENTS
#Settlers or Investment
 cef_laplata.1.t: "Help from [Root.ColonialParent.GetName]"
 cef_laplata.1.d: "In a momentous turn of events, our burgeoning colonies under the guidance of our overlord have received a substantial infusion of investment, propelling their development and prosperity to new heights. This historic occasion marks a pivotal milestone in the shared journey towards colonial expansion and economic advancement. This will herald a new era of growth and opportunity for the colonies, forging stronger bonds and laying the foundation for a legacy that will endure for generations to come. However, we must decide whether to request greater funds or more settlers from the mainland"

#Congress of Tucuman
 cef_laplata.2.t: "The Congress of [Root.Capital.GetName]"
 cef_laplata.2.d: "Delegates from across the [Root.GovernmentName]  of the Río de la Plata have gathered in the city of [Root.Capital.GetName], convened by the [Root.GovernmentName], to deliberate on the future of [Root.GetName]. Against the backdrop of simmering discontent and revolutionary fervor, the congress represents a historic opportunity for the disparate regions and factions to unite under a common cause: independence from the dominion of [Root.ColonialParent.GetName]. Over the course of weeks, delegates engage in impassioned debates, negotiations, and deliberations, each seeking to shape the destiny of the nation. The Congress of [Root.Capital.GetName] is not merely a political assembly but a crucible of national identity and unity. Delegates from diverse backgrounds—labourers, intellectuals, military leaders, and representatives of indigenous communities—contribute their voices to the discourse. Despite the challenges of ideological differences, regional rivalries, and external pressures, the congress perseveres. In [GetMonth] [GetYear], amidst an atmosphere charged with anticipation and resolve, the delegates reach a historic consensus. Led by figures such as [Root.Monarch.GetName], they solemnly proclaim a declaration of independence, severing ties with [Root.ColonialParent.GetName] and laying the foundation for a sovereign nation."
 cef_laplata.2a: "¡Libertad!"
