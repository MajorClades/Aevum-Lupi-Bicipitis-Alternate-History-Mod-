 gen_ita.14.test:0 "The Consolidation of Corsica"
 gen_ita.14.desc:0 "100 years ago, Corsica was a patchwork of tiny fiefdoms and feudal principalities. Many petty states battled it out for meager riches that would barely pay for a proper meal in Padania. This equilibrium was enforced by the outside duxy of Turres, which made sure no state could challenge their hegemony over northern Sardinia and the Tyrrhenian sea. This pitiful state was ended by one man with a dream, one Ghjilormu.\n Hailing from a minor noble lineage from Veneto, his parents were foreigners, but he was a Corsican through and through. He saw the sorry state of his beloved island and resolved to end the fragmentation, once and for all. As he gathered his host and began his campaigns, he faced opposition from not just Corsican enemies, but the Dux of Turres himself. In a stunning military victory that defined the rest of his conquests, he defeated a numerically superior Turresian force while they were making a naval landing in the south. By 1444, the isle of Corsica is almost entirely united under his rule, and only a few minor fortresses and bishoprics remain in the mountains of the north. A dilemma has emerged, whether to crush the last resistance once and for all or to form a more equitable union."

 gen_ita.16.test:0 "Mecenatism of Today"
 gen_ita.16.desc:0 "In the early days of the Renaissance, many artists and scholars were maintained in royal courts by the noble's gold. It would not be difficult for other rich merchants to also acquire these artists but that would diminish the quality of the works and advice the court can obtain if the merchants pay more than the crown.
