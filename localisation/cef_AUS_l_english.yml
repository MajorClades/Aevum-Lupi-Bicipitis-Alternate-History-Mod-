 cef_aus_flav.4.d:0 "Good news, governor. You have been appointed to oversee the new colony in Ulimaroa. Tho, calling it a colony in the proper sense may be a bit presumptuous. The crown has declared this territory to be a penal colony. That means we can expect a steady supply of convicts. However, there is no guarantee that they will be in a state to be put to labour; the conditions on the prison ships are less than hygienic, and the journey is quite long. This long travel time also means that our overlord won't be able to intervene in critical matters. All these factors contribute to us being seen as unimportant in the empire. The task laid in front of us is not an easy one, but with a bit of effort, we can wrestle this situation and turn this territory into a blossoming land."

However, the farmers say there is nothing to fear and want the troops to deal with the birds as swiftly as possible."

 cef_aus_flav.14.b:0 "Resistance is futile"
 
 cef_aus_flav.15.t:0 "Emu Hunters"
 cef_aus_flav.15.d:0 "It took a few pamphlets, but we soon managed to gather large enough numbers of hunters to help us deal with the bird issue we are facing. And it was a good decision. The hunters, skilled in the disposal of animals, made a quick work of the infestation. Now, we just need to congratulate them on a job well done."

 cef_aus_flav.19.d:0 "Our troops successfully got into the striking range without being detected. They could now break the stealth and obliterate the birds with explosives, leaving behind nothing but feathers. Eventually, they could engage in good old-fashioned throat-cutting and backstabbing."

 cef_aus_flav.20.t:0 "Emu's are retreating"
 cef_aus_flav.20.d:0 "Cavalry charge into the flank of the herd was enough to panic them completely. The birds are now running around like headless chickens in a foolish attempt to save their lives. They shall not be allowed that luxury. "

 cef_aus_flav.20.b:0 "Run them down"
 
 cef_aus_flav.21.t:0 "The End is Nigh"
 cef_aus_flav.21.d:0 "Engaging with the birds is starting to feel quite hopeless. Our infantry is running out of ammo, and our horses got scared by the screeching birds. It appears there is no way for us to win this clash. However, we could order artillery bombardment of the battlefield and hopefully wipe out the birds, unfortunately, with a portion of our troops."

 cef_aus_flav.23.d:0 "The war was long and our enemy was formidable. We suffered some losses during the engagements, but eventually, we secured a victory."
 cef_aus_flav.23.a:0 "But at what cost"
 
 cef_aus_flav.24.t:0 "Shameful defeat"
 cef_aus_flav.24.d:0 "Our army was completely crushed and humiliated. The emus claimed victory this day. And now, with no resistance in their way, they will march toward the capital. There is nothing we can do but accept our defeat and hail our conquerors."
 cef_aus_flav.24.a:0 "Hail our new overlords!"
