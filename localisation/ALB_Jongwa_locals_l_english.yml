	YAN_one_eyed_du_desc:0 "Xiahuo Dun has many epithets: Pacifier of the North, Blade of Guo Hong, Terror of Windellia. However, the one that stands out the most is "One-Eyed General." How did he earn this name? Guo Hong, then a mere warlord, was patrolling what he believed to be a desolate valley to scout a passage for his soldiers. While riding his steed, an arrow grazed his face—he had been ambushed. More arrows rained down upon his troops, leaving only Guo Hong and Xiahuo Dun alive after the deadly hail. During the attack, Xiahuo Dun was struck by an arrow that lodged in one of his eyes. Without hesitation, Xiahuo acted swiftly. He plucked the arrow from his head, consumed his own eye, and loaded the bloody projectile into the crossbow of a fallen comrade. Whether by the will of heaven or his extraordinary precision, the arrow struck the ambushing general, killing him instantly. The remaining archers, horrified by the sight, scattered in fear. Xiahuo Dun would go on to perform even more remarkable feats and steadily rose through the ranks. Eventually, Guo Hong entrusted him with defending his holdings in Jongwa while he rode off to vanquish the barbarians."
	YAN_good_servant_desc:0 "Xiahuo clan was by all-mean an reowned clan, however they never rose to such high station until Guo Hong elevated them to Regency of Jongwa, this worked in our advantage however as we are able to guage one loyalty and profession with quick glance."
