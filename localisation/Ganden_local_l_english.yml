#Events
 gand.1.test: "Capital of Biono"
 gand.1.desc: "The island of Biono has many cities who can be worthy of a capital status:\nLisverik, who stands watch over the Channel to ensure the trade passes safely; Londen, built 1400 years ago, also benefits greatly from the trade from Elland; Brakom, home of the Swedish who first landed and already a great city; Koyeltav, a great place of gathering for the Àsatrù faith and its followers;\nHome, where the heart of our people truly is."

 gand.1d: "Koyeltav, to Divine Providence."
 gand.1e: "Home, to hearth and heart."

 gand.2.test: "The State of Kögern"
 gand.2.desc: "Kögern sucks. It's widely known in the combined militias of the Union that the worst place to end up is Kögern, defending against some Scotian clansmen that think they can scale the sheer walls of the fortress by the town. The weather stinks, the food is even worse than the mackerel-based slop they call a meal in Bylandr, and the people aren't particularly friendly either. However, it does have some strategic importance.\n\nIn the 11th century, Olaf the Strong brought unity to the Geats and led our people on a glorious string of conquests. They went as far south as Brakom and as far west as Belgia, almost completely subjugating the clans of Scotia. Sadly, he did have to die and his united Geatish kingdom eventually fell to infighting and inheritance before being conquered by the perfidious Zladinians. Most of Geatish Scotia fell. Except Kögern. Kögern managed to stay controlled by the kingdom of Kadlen up until the formation of the union, where now we have a new use for it.\n\nKögern is perfectly located to act as a jumping-off point for our conquests in Scotia - all we need to do is make it an actually useful place."
 gand.2a: "It's going to be hard to convince people to move there."
