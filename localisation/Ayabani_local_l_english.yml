#####EVENTS

 hwan.1.t:0 "An Empire Beyond our Wildest Dreams"
 hwan.1.d:0 "reddit moment"
 hwan.1a:0 "Obviously Hwan-guk never existed. Just go with Daehan and call it a day."
 hwan.1b:0 "Hwan-guk was real and we are the new Hwan-guk."

 tamna.1.t:0 "The Resettlement Commission"
 tamna.1.d:0 "With the liberation of Korea complete, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has decided to sponsor the creation of a government agency dedicated to restoring the Korean penninsula to its rightful owners: the Koreans. The Mongol tribes will be driven north and out of our lands forever, their territories being turned over to Tamnan and exiled Korean families to restore the land."
 tamna.1a:0 "It will be like Goryeo never fell."

 ayabani.1.t:0 "Fusing the Army and the Navy"
 ayabani.1.d:0 "With the War of Reunification drawing ever closer, an interesting proposal has reached the ears of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. The Army and Navy have long worked in tandem with one another, even during the days of the old Kingdom. As such, tt has been suggested that in order to better coordinate our forces in the coming war, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] should be appointed Supreme Commander of the Army as well as Supreme Commander of the Navy. This would effectively merge both branches of the military under one leader. This is a risky plan. If the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is not up to the task of commanding the military this could prove to be a disaster. How shall we proceed?"
 ayabani.1a:0 "Make it so."
 ayabani.1b:0 "That could cause too many issues."

 ayabani.2.t:0 "The Fate of the Three Armies"
 ayabani.2.d:0 "The Grand Army of Tamna is nothing more than a relic of the old kingdom. It was first established in the wake of our victory against Yamatai-ko centuries ago, when a foothold was first established in Nihon proper. When we restored it in preparation for the coming war, it was not the first time we had done so. And we were not the only ones to do it. With the reintegration of the rival kingdoms into one realm, we are now forced to confront the fact that we now have three "Grand Armies of Tamna" under our control.\n\The prevailing opinion among the nobles of the court is that the best course of action would be to simply disband the excess armies and ensure ours remains the only one. They argue that the Grand Army of Tamna served the Tamna Kings with distinction for centuries, and it would continue to do so unto eternity.\n\nReformers in the court, however, have argued against this. They argue that it was the inaction of the Grand Army following the death of King Yeong that allowed the succession crisis to grow to such a point that rival kings were able to declare their own states; That the original Grand Army was rife with issues: corruption, nepotism, and leaders playing favorite for one particular family or another. They suggest we disband the Grand Army altogether and seek a new way forward. It falls to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to break this stalemate."
 ayabani.2a:0 "The Grand Army worked for our ancestors. It will work for us."
 ayabani.2b:0 "We cannot let nostalgia blind us. Disband the Grand Army."

 ayabani.3.t:0 "The Fate of the Three Armies"
 ayabani.3.d:0 "The Grand Army of Tamna is nothing more than a relic of the old kingdom. It was first established in the wake of our victory against Yamatai-ko centuries ago, when a foothold was first established in Nihon proper. When we restored it in preparation for the coming war, it was not the first time we had done so. And we were not the only ones to do it. With the reintegration of the rival kingdoms into one realm, we are now forced to confront the fact that we now have three "Grand Armies of Tamna" under our control.\n\The prevailing opinion among the nobles of the court is that the best course of action would be to simply disband the excess armies and ensure ours remains the only one.

They suggest we disband the Grand Army altogether and seek a new way forward. It falls to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to break this stalemate."
 ayabani.3a:0 "The Grand Army worked for our ancestors. It will work for us."
 ayabani.3b:0 "We cannot let nostalgia blind us. Disband the Grand Army."

 ayabani.4.t:0 "Samgugtong-il"
 ayabani.4.d:0 "30 years ago, King Yeong Go died childless, and the Tamna Kingdom shattered. We have existed in a state of undeclared civil war ever since. But that ends now. Our army stands unparalleled. Our navy is prepared to face any challenge. The best and the brightest have rallied to our cause. There are no more plans left to finalize, and no more questions left to answer. The Three Kingdoms will be unified, no matter the cost. We will claim what is rightfully ours!"
 ayabani.4a:0 "Or we will die trying."

 ayabani.5.t:0 "Our Enemies Make for War"
 ayabani.5.d:0 "30 years ago, King Yeong Go died childless, and the Tamna Kingdom shattered. We have existed in a state of undeclared civil war ever since. But it seems that will soon come to an end. Our rivals have already made moves to restart the succession crisis. While we had hopes of doing so ourselves, we don't have many options left. We can either fight or denigrate ourselves to try and postpone it until we're ready. How shall we proceed?"
 ayabani.5a:0 "We have no choice. To arms!"
 ayabani.5b:0 "We aren't ready yet. Do whatever it takes to delay this."

 ayabani.6.t:0 ""The Curse of the Mirror""
 ayabani.6.d:0 "Several days ago, a travelling Mudang visited the Royal Court. She claimed to have a message for The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] from [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] ancestors. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] decided to entertain this visit and met with her in private, but hasn't been the same since. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has begun compulsively destroying every mirror within sight, claiming that the Mudang had done something that "ruined [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] face." Nobody else in the court has noticed anything wrong with [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] face and this point has been made several times, but the destruction of any reflective surface has continued nonetheless."
 ayabani.6a:0 "Okay Your Majesty, we'll get rid of all the mirrors for you..."

 ayabani.7.t:0 "The Final Confrontation"
 ayabani.7.d:0 "The Throne Room was abuzz. The Traveler in White had returned. He bowed before the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle].\n\n"Your Majesty, it is a pleasure to see you again. I hope you have thought over my offer-" Without warning, the Seer barged into the Throne Room, shoving past the guards.\n\n"Your Majesty, surely you will not heed the words of this fraud? As I have told you, he seeks to bring nothing but chaos and destruction to this land. His "teachings" are nothing but lies!" The Traveler simply smiled at the Seer.\n\n"Ah, my old student. It is good to see you again." The Seer didn't seem to share the sentiment, and if looks could kill the Traveler would have disintegrated on the spot. "But I promise, you not understanding my teachings does not mean they are wrong." The room went quiet, everyone inside stopping to watch the two men stare each other down. Out of nowhere the Seer drew a dagger from inside his Hanbok. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] stood up just as quickly, held out [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] hand, and spoke."
 ayabani.7a:0 "This Traveler is a guest. Guards, please escort the Seer away.""
 ayabani.7b:0 "I will not let my realm fall to chaos. Guards, escort the Traveler away.""

##MISSIONs
 aya_navy_title:0 "To Conquer the Seas"
 aya_navy_desc:0 "The Old Kingdom was always conscious about maintainging a strong navy. With our origins in the island of Tamna, that is not surprising. But when the Old Kingdom fell, we began to focus far more on our holdings in Nihon and the navy fell to neglect. With war on the horizon, we must make sure our navy is strong enough to defeat our enemies."

 aya_merge_army_navy_title:0 "The Question of Command"
 aya_yamatai_support_desc:0 "An ever present concern of the coming war is that of logistics. As such, several low ranking military officers have put forth a siggestion: appointing our ruler as leader of the military."

 aya_unification_war_title:0 "The Great War of Unification"
 aya_unification_war_desc:0 "All of our preparation has led up to this moment. We have waited for 30 years for the right opportunity to fall into our lap. But we will wait no longer. The Kingdoms of Tamna will be united, and we will be the ones to do it!"

 aya_army_title:0 "The Grand Army of Tamna"
 aya_army_desc:0 "The Grand Army of Tamna was the principle fighting force of the Old Kingdom. If we are to take our rightful place as their heirs, we must make sure that our army is able to live up to what it once was. Officially restoring the Grand Army of Tamna will go a long way in ensuring that becomes a reality."

 tmn_econ_title:0 "Rebuilding the Economy"
 tmn_econ_desc:0 "get cancer"

 tmn_stalin_title:0 "Purge the Bureaucracy"
 tmn_stalin_desc:0 "get it"

 tmn_nobles_title:0 "Reign in the Nobility"
 tmn_nobles_desc:0 "Folks, these bourgeoisie, they're no good."

 tmn_war_pacifism_title:0 "Declare War on Pacifism"
 tmn_war_pacifism_desc:0 "buncha nerds"

 tmn_unbreakable_union_title:0 "Unbreakable Union"
 tmn_unbreakable_union_desc:0 "go ahead, take it from me"

 tmn_three_armies_title:0 "The Three Grand Armies"
 tmn_three_armies_desc:0 "this is getting out of hand, now there are three of them!"

 tmn_trucebreak_title:0 "Breaking the Treaty of Settsu"
 tmn_trucebreak_desc:0 "In 1204 the Kingdom of Tamna, following their defeat in the siege of Kyoto, signed a treaty with the Japanese agreeing to withdraw from our occupied territories in exchange for peace with Yamatai. This put an end to the Tamnan Golden Age and the kingdom began to stagnate. If we are to undo the wrongs of the past, our first step should be to do away with this vile treaty. We will not allow Japanese barbarians to put a limit on our greatness!"

 tmn_cant_spell_chrysanthemum_title:0 "The Coronation"
 tmn_cant_spell_chrysanthemum_desc:0 "At long last the great city of Kyoto, and with it the Kingdom of Yamatai-koku, have fallen. We have finished what our ancestors started more than 200 years ago. We will celebrate this great victory by crowning our great King the King of Yamatai. With luck this may even convince the Japanese of the righteousness of our rule."

 tmn_kuomintang_title:0 "The Northern Expedition"
 tmn_kuomintang_desc:0 "The people of northern Nihon have struggled against the Japanese for almost as long as we have. One could imagine this would make us kindred spirits. One would be wrong to imagine that. In reality, the fact the Japanese even struggled against them to begin with is simply proof of their unworthiness to rule these islands. By conquering the Ainu we will cement oursevles as the rightful and undisputed rulers of this land."

 tmn_nihon_title:0 "Conquerors of the Sun"
 tmn_nihon_desc:0 "In 1204 the Old Kingdom of Tamna was reduced to an irrelevant nation. Our existence was propped up by Goryeo, and the Japanese viewed us as nothing but freeloaders on their rightful territory. We were the laughingstock of the region. Now, Goryeo is long gone, and the Japanese have bent the knee to their rightful rulers. Our revenge has been swift, and it has been sweet. And now we stand as the undisputed Kings of Nihon."

 tmn_sos_title:0 "Rescuing our Brothers"
 tmn_sos_desc:0 "A century ago our closest ally, the Kingdom of Goryeo, was destroyed. Barbarian invaders came in from the north, murdering the king in cold blood and destroying a dynasty that had ruled for 400 years. While the old Kingdom managed to seize several border territories when the barbarian kingdom fell, the status quo has lasted for decades. We were powerless to stop the fall, but now we can undo this great mistake. With our territories in Korea secured we will laucnh a strike at the weak southern Khanates."

 tmn_mac_title:0 "Reclaiming the Capital"
 tmn_mac_desc:0 "With southern Korea secured, we can move on to greater targets. The Jalayrids, the descendants of the vile Dayan, have made Kaesong the capital of their Kingdom. It was the city where the Kingdom of Goryeo fell and where Dayan proclaimed himelf "Khan of the Solonguns." This injustice, this mockery, cannot be allowed to continue. The Koreans of Kaesong cry for liberation, and we will answer. We will drive the Mongols from the old capital and restore it to its rightful rulers."

 tmn_wiry_title:0 "Up the Penninsula"
 tmn_wiry_desc:0 "The Capital, as well as the south, have been liberated. All that remains now is to eliminate the last vesitges of Mongol ruler over Korea. We will push all the way up to the border with the northern barbarians and ensure that not one Mongol soldier is left before us. Our ancestors demand it. Only then will our second greatest shame be truly avenged."

 tmn_gorg_title:0 "The Fate of Goryeo"
 tmn_gorg_desc:0 "The territories of the old Kingdom of Goryeo have been liberated from their barbarian squatters. Now we must decide what to do with the penninsula. There are those that call for a complete restoration of the old kingdom of Goryeo, with a distant descendat of the last king being put on the throne. However, there are also those who believe that instead of restoring the old king, we claim the crown of Goryeo and add it to our collection."

 tmn_hoi4_title:0 "Resettlement Commission"
 tmn_hoi4_desc:0 "The penninsula may have been reclaimed and the Mongol Khans killed, but the fact remains that large parts of the penninsula are still occupied by tribals. To counter this, we will establish a new agency dedicated to driving the tribes out of our territory and resettling it with Korean exiles who fled the collapse, as well as enterprising Tamnans who wish for new opportunities."

 tmn_changbai_title:0 "Beyond the Changbai"
 tmn_changbai_desc:0 "Both Korea and Nihon have been secured, but all is not well. Barbarian tribes launch constant raids on our Korean territories. This threat cannot go unanswered. We will march our men through the Changbai mountains and secure ourselves a foothold in barbarian territory, through which we will pacify the entire region. The safety of our people shall be our top priority."

 tmn_frontier_title:0 "Taming the Frontier"
 tmn_frontier_desc:0 "The northern frontiers of the lands beyond the Amur are populated by sparse and disparate tribes. They have attempted to reach out to us several times, claiming they simply wish to "facilitate trade" and "establish friendly relations." We see through their lies. While they are weak, they still represent a threat to our interests. We must ensure these tribes cannot join forces to threaten our borders. Only by pacifying them will they be rendered harmless."

 tmn_coast_title:0 "Conquering the Coast"
 tmn_coast_desc:0 "The various barbarian tribes along the coast present no threat to us at the moment. They have yet to adequately master seafaring. That does not mean they will not do so in the future, however. Our experience with Japanese pirates has taught us that threats from the sea cannot be taken lightly. We must dispersse these tribes before they can threaten our fragile ports."

 tmn_jesse_title:0 "A Saviour"
 tmn_jesse_desc:0 "The Mongolian and Yenisian Steppe is home to a number of faiths, chief among them being Shamanism like ours. However, it is also home to two far more interesting faiths: Christianity and Buddhism. With the lands of these barbarians under our control and our faith spreading more and more by the day, we have a chance to integrate one of these faiths into the Royal Pantheon."

 tmn_jade_title:0 "Throne of Jade and Light"
 tmn_jade_desc:0 "The ruling ideology of the Chinese elite has been the ideas of Confucius for centuries. While some have considered integrating him into the pantheon, two interesting alternatives have been suggested: China's Jade Emperor, and the prophet Mani worshipped by those in the south of China. Only one may be chosen, for it will be seen as an insult to the followers of the other. We must choose carefully which spirit to pray to."

 tmn_faith_title:0 "The Sun or the Bear"
 tmn_faith_desc:0 "One of the greatest strengths of our faith is its malleability. The spirits a believer prays to are, for the most part, up to the believer themselves. And now, with the islands of Nihon under our control, we have taken over land belonging to two different faiths. Integrating one of them into the pantheon of our royal family will go a long way in integrating the believers."

 tmn_amur_title:0 "Tigers of the Amur"
 tmn_amur_desc:0 "The barbarian tribes of the Amur have been pacified. From Naju to Albazin out people live in harmony. They are happy and safe, no longer having to worry about marauding bands of barbarians burning down their villages. Like the mighty tiger we have destroyed every foe before us and ushered in a new era of prosperity across our great land."

 tmn_heaven_title:0 "To Conquer Heaven"
 tmn_heaven_desc:0 "We have established ourselves as masters of Nihon, Korea, and the Amur. But we are not content with playing second fiddle to anyone. The Empire of China stands as a mockery of all who do not kowtow before the Chinese. We will stand for it no longer. In the name of all the people of the United Kingdoms and all who stand in opposition to the Mandate of Heaven."

 tmn_wall_title:0 "Along the Great Wall"
 tmn_wall_desc:0 "The Great Wall of China was built to keep barbarian invaders from entering China from the north. While it did not help against Guo Hong, or us, it serves as an excellent route for our armies on what territories to conquer next. With the Wall to our backs the people of northern China will have nowhere to run from our triumphant armies."

 tmn_river_title:0 "Like a Flooding River"
 tmn_river_desc:0 "The Yangtze River serves as both the lifeblood of northern China as well as a source of constant threat with its regular flooding. Like the Yangtze, our armies will flood across the land. We will annihilate all who oppose us and make sure that no civilization exists in this land without our permission."

 tmn_plains_title:0 "Central Plains War"
 tmn_plains_desc:0 ""

 tmn_tno_title:0 "The Twin Pearls"
 tmn_tno_desc:0 "China has fallen to our armies, but one last prize remains unclaimed. The lands of Guangdong have been in the hands of disparate barbarian warlords for far too long. It would be far better for all parties, aside from the barbarian kings of course, if the land were to be under our control. These twin pearls of China must be ours."

 tmn_steppe_title:0 "Subjugating the Steppe"
 tmn_steppe_desc:0 "The tribes of the steppe were once feared warriors, barbarians capable of bringing down entire civilizations over a percieved slight. Guo Hong was quick to put them in their place, and they have yet to recover. The Khalkha tribes that occupy the Mongolian plateau are the weakest of the bunch, and would make for excellent subjects."

 tmn_mountain_title:0 "Moving the Mountains"
 tmn_mountain_desc:0 "Guo Hong's dispersal of barbarian tribes, while in principle a good idea, allowed barbarians from the north to take up residence in these newly unoccupied lands. The Yenisians chief among them. If we are to secure overlordship over the steppe these mountain-dwelling tribals must be dealt with. We cannot allow them to raid our newly pacified subjects."

 tmn_republic_title:0 "Breaking the Republics"
 tmn_republic_desc:0 "The presence of the Silk Road led to the rise of a great many republics in and around the city of Gaochang. It is an affront to all things good in this world. These barbarians, holding their "elections,"  act like it makes them our equals. They must be put in their place. They must be made to understand that adopting civility does not make them civilized."

 tmn_temujin_title:0 "Our own Khanate"
 tmn_temujin_desc:0 "Mongol chieftans often speak of a destiny denied to them. They claim that Guo Hong was only able to achieve his many feats due to timing, and a little bit of luck. We have once again proven them wrong. A century after Guo Hong nearly wiped them out the Mongols have been subjugated once more. They have been disgraceful in defeat, but we must be graceful in victory. We will proclaim ourselves as the new Khans of this land, based on the strength of our armies. There is, after all, much we can learn from our new subjects. It would be shame to waste it."

 tmn_empire_title:0 "An Empire Beyond our Dreams"
 tmn_empire_desc:0 "Both Korea and Nihon have been secured, but all is not well. Barbarian tribes launch constant raids on our Korean territories. This threat cannot go unanswered. We will march our men through the Changbai mountains and secure ourselves a foothold in barbarian territory, through which we will pacify the entire region. The safety of our people shall be our top priority."

#####CUSTOM
 AYABANI_TT_1:0 "This is the point of no return. The status quo will shatter and the Tamna Kingdoms will devolve into war. Make sure you are ready."
 AYABANI_TT_2:0 "The War will be delayed by a year"
 AYABANI_TT_3:0 "We will restore the Grand Army of Tamna. With the war approaching, the negative aspects of the armys will not impact us. This will change if we reunify the Kingdom."
 AYABANI_TT_4:0 "The Seer glared at the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], but complied."
 AYABANI_TT_5:0 "With a smirk on the Seer's face, the Traveler was taken away."
 AYABANI_TT_6:0 "get cancer"
 AYABANI_TT_7:0 "We will lay claim to the territory owned by Yamatai-ko when the treaty was first signed."
