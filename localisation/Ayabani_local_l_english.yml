 hwan.1.t:0 "An Empire Beyond our Wildest Dreams"
 hwan.1.d:0 "When King Malro first began purchasing land in Wae from Yamatai-ko centuries ago, a Tamnan Empire was inconceivable. When Tamnan and Korean Armies began beating back Japanese armies and establishing a foothold in Nihon, a Tamnan Empire was nothing more than an aspiration. When King Bongre died without an heir in 1411 and Tamna shattered, a Tamnan Empire was deemed impossible. We have proven ourselves, and our many doubters, wrong. Our empire streches from northern Nihon to the wild west of Mongolia, from the frigid wastes beyond the Amur to a paradis in southern China. We are not just a Great Tamnan Empire, we are the greatest empire to ever exist. Not by the amount of land we have conquered, but by just how unlikely it was for us to conquer it. Many are content to rest on our laurels and usher in a new era of peace.\n\nNot everyone though.\n\nRecently translated documents from ancient times have seemingly revealed a Korean Empire that streched all the way to Persia and Europe known as Hwan-guk. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s closest advisors have advises caution, stating the Hwan, but dreams of glory are not so easily forgotten."
 hwan.1a:0 "Obviously Hwan-guk never existed. And besides, we are Tamnans, not Koreans."
 hwan.1b:0 "Real or not, we will revive the legacy of Hwan-guk!"

 tamna.1.t:0 "The Resettlement Commission"
 tamna.1.d:0 "With the liberation of Korea complete, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has decided to sponsor the creation of a government agency dedicated to restoring the Korean penninsula to its rightful owners: the Koreans. The Mongol tribes will be driven north and out of our lands forever, their territories being turned over to Tamnan and exiled Korean families to restore the land."
 tamna.1a:0 "It will be like Goryeo never fell."

 tamna.2.t:0 "The Matter of Amishi"
 tamna.2.d:0 "To the south of the island of the island of Wae lies a small kingdom. The Amishi Kingdom. They once paid tributed to the Tamna Kings of old, but the fall of the Old Kingdom has given them delusions of independence. Now that we have reunitied and vanquished our oldest enemy, it is time we correct this. The Amishi are isolated, and nobody will come to their aid. The advisors to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] have already prepared a strongly worded letter to the Amishi imploring them to become our subjects once again."
 tamna.2a:0 "Send the letter."

 tamna.3.t:0 "A Letter"
 tamna.3.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] sat upon [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] throne, staring off into the distance. Life in Amishi was peaceful, if a little uneventful. Ever since the Tamnan Kingdom fell because they couldn't decide what inbred noble to make their new king they had been enjoying the fruits of independence: trade with the Japanese, with Chinese merchants, and even with enterprising Tamnan merchants who bothered to remember they existed. But lately, that trade had dried up. Tamnan merchants stopped arriving years ago, and recently not a single Japanese ship has reached their shores. It was a strange turn of events to be sure. Before [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] could ruminate on this any further, however, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] was handed a letter. At first [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] assumed it was from a friend. Perhaps someone seeking to open up a new trade route like the enterprising Wun merchant from last week. But it wasn't a letter.\n\nIt was a threat.\n\nIt seemed the Tamnans had not only reunited, not only conquered the Japanese, but worst of all they had remembered Amishi existed. And they weren't happy about that."
 tamna.3a:0 "We don't have a choice. To spare my people I must submit."
 tamna.3b:0 "We may die, but I will never bow before false kings."

 tamna.4.t:0 "Amishi Folds"
 tamna.4.d:0 "We have received a response to the letter we sent to the Amishi. They have humbly accepted our request that they be returned to the fold. The Amishi Royal Family is on its way to $CAPITAL$ now to pay tribute and formalize the integration of their kingdom into ours."
 tamna.4a:0 "As expected."

 tamna.5.t:0 "Amishi Resists"
 tamna.5.d:0 "We have received a response to the letter we sent to the Amishi. It seems in their decades of independence they have grown something akin to a spine, as the have refused our demands outright, referring to us as false kings and declaring that they will never again be subjugated by the likes of us."
 tamna.5a:0 "We'll see about that."

 tamna.6.t:0 "Success of the Resettlement Commission"
 tamna.6.d:0 "Following an extended campaign of immigration, emigration, and expelling barbarians, a new area of the Korean peninsula has become majority Korean for the first time in centuries. The former inhabitants have been sent into exile to the north."
 tamna.6a:0 "Lovely"

 tamna.7.t:0 "The Sun or the Bear"
 tamna.7.d:0 "The entirety of Nihon has fallen under our control. This has presented a unique opportunity not seen in any other period of Tamnan history. Constant daily interactions with other religions. But unlike dogmatic followers of Shinto or Kamuryamat, our faith is truly pluralist. We do not dogmatically cling to one set of deities. How one worships the Gods and ancestors is entirely up to them. Not every person worships every God, and some may go unworshipped for centuries. Such was the case with Dangun, who was mostly localized to Korea itself, before King Bokryeong made public that his family would pray to him in 1107. This began the long standing tradition of the Tamnan Royal Family being able to integrate other deities into the faith by simply publically extolling their virtue. We have a chance to do the same with the faiths now within our borders, and two Gods have presented themselves: Amaterasu, Goddess of the Sun and Ancestor of the Japanese Royal Family, and Kotan-kar-kamuy, oft forgotten creator God of the Ainu."
 tamna.7a:0 "We will integrate Amaterasu"
 tamna.7b:0 "We will integrate Kotan-kar-kamuy"

 tamna.8.t:0 "Choosing a Throne"
 tamna.8.d:0 "China is a very large place. One would expect such a place to have a great many religions populating it. This is not the case. For centuries the dominant ideology in China were those ideas first espoused by the Great Confucius centuries ago. Much of China still follows them to this very day, as do every ruler who wishes to establish themselves in the region. His influence is so great there are many within the court calling for his deification. While that may occur at the local level, it is not something the Royal Family is interested in. Instead, two opportunities have presented themselves: the Jade Emperor, purported founder of Chinese civilization, and the Prophet Mani followed by those in southern China."
 tamna.8a:0 "We will integrate Jade Emperor"
 tamna.8b:0 "We will integrate the Prophet Mani"

 tamna.9.t:0 "Choosing a Saviour"
 tamna.9.d:0 "The Mongolian plateau is home to many faiths. Chief among them is Tengrism. The shamanistic faith of the Mongols and countless other steppe tribes. A faith so easy to integrate it barely desevres mention. But Tengri is not the only God in the sky. In southern in western Mongolia there are two other faiths popular with the more civilized inhabitants of the region. The faiths of Buddhism and Christianity. Each claims to provide the way to enlightenment and salvation for the practitioner. While the faith itself is incompatible with the way of our ancestors, we can acknowledge the positive aspects of both. Chief among them being their central figures: the Buddha, and Jesus Christ."
 tamna.9a:0 "We will integrate Buddha"
 tamna.9b:0 "We will integrate Jesus"

 tamna.10.t:0 "A War of Revenge"
 tamna.10.d:0 "In 1253, the Grand Army of Tamna and the Army of Goryeo were laying siege to Kyoto. It was what should of been the penultimate moment of Tamnan glory. Our age old enemy, the vile Kingdom of Yamatai-ko, was doomed. It was a matter of months before Kyoto would fall and all of Nihon would lie open before us. Destiny saw fit to spit in our eye, however. Dayan Jalayirid, freshly exiled from the Empire of 10,000 Armies following his father's failed revolt a year prior, marched his barbarian hordes past the Changbai mountains into Goryeo. When the King of Goryeo mustered an army to drive out the invaders, he was slain. His kingdom dissolved in a matter of days. And our allies in the siege of Kyoto were no more. Without warning the Japanese sallied from the city and defeated our armies, humiliating us and forcing us to sign the treaty of Settsu. Now, with the south reclaimed, we may right the wrong that saw us relegated to a minor power. We will drive the barbarians from Kaesong, ending centuries of humiliation and liberating the capital of Goryeo from their tyranny."
 tamna.10a:0 "For the memory Goryeo, for the honor our ancestors, and for the glory of Tamna!"

 tamna.11.t:0 "Reorganising Mongolia"
 tamna.11.d:0 "All of Mongolia now belongs to our great Empire. The petty squabbling of the barbarian tribes has been brought to a permanent end and, recognising our overwhelming strength, they now look to us for guidance. We now face a dilemma: there are far too many tribes in the region to manage effectively. We are now faced with a choice on which of the Mongolian tribes we wish to elevate to civilisation. The other tribes will be forcibly integrated and, if they refuse, destroyed."
 tamna.11a:0 "Elevate the Khalkha, they've suffered enough."
 tamna.11b:0 "The Evenk should be easy to control, they shall be elevated."
 tamna.11c:0 "Oh, that's right, the Chile exist. Elevate them, why not."
 tamna.11d:0 "None of these tribes hold a candle to the Yenisei. They will be our chosen."

 ayabani.1.t:0 "Fusing the Army and the Navy"
 ayabani.1.d:0 "With the War of Reunification drawing ever closer, an interesting proposal has reached the ears of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. The Army and Navy have long worked in tandem with one another, even during the days of the old Kingdom. As such, tt has been suggested that in order to better coordinate our forces in the coming war, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] should be appointed Supreme Commander of the Army as well as Supreme Commander of the Navy. This would effectively merge both branches of the military under one leader. This is a risky plan. If the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is not up to the task of commanding the military this could prove to be a disaster. How shall we proceed?"
 ayabani.1a:0 "Make it so."
 ayabani.1b:0 "That could cause too many issues."

 ayabani.2.t:0 "The Fate of the Three Armies"
 ayabani.2.d:0 "The Grand Army of Tamna is nothing more than a relic of the old kingdom. It was first established in the wake of our victory against Yamatai-ko centuries ago, when a foothold was first established in Nihon proper. When we restored it in preparation for the coming war, it was not the first time we had done so. And we were not the only ones to do it. With the reintegration of the rival kingdoms into one realm, we are now forced to confront the fact that we now have three Grand Armies of Tamna under our control.\n\The prevailing opinion among the nobles of the court is that the best course of action would be to simply disband the excess armies and ensure ours remains the only one. They argue that the Grand Army of Tamna served the Tamna Kings with distinction for centuries, and it would continue to do so unto eternity.\n\nReformers in the court, however, have argued against this. They argue that it was the inaction of the Grand Army following the death of King Yeong that allowed the succession crisis to grow to such a point that rival kings were able to declare their own states; That the original Grand Army was rife with issues: corruption, nepotism, and leaders playing favorite for one particular family or another. They suggest we disband the Grand Army altogether and seek a new way forward. It falls to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to break this stalemate."
 ayabani.2a:0 "The Grand Army worked for our ancestors. It will work for us."
 ayabani.2b:0 "We cannot let nostalgia blind us. Disband the Grand Army."

 ayabani.3.t:0 "A Fiery Coronation"
 ayabani.3.d:0 "The Grand Army of Tamna had assembled before the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] stood just outside the Imperial Palace of Kyoto, dressed in full military gear, a torch in one hand and a sword in the other. Today was an important day in the history of Tamna. It was the coronation of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of Tamna as the new [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of Yamatai-ko. The Royal Family, whose unbroken line of succession had been such a source of pride for the Yamatai in the past, were either dead or in hiding; in other words, irrelevant. All of their holdings in Nihon had fallen to the Tamna, and the treaty that had kept them caged for so long was worth less than the dirt they stood on.\n\nKyoto had long stood as symbol of Yamatai-ko. Their ancient capital, the place where Tamna was defeated. Now, it would serve as a grim reminder of how fickle a mistress fate can be.\n\nA Yamato Prince who failed to evacuate the city with his family was dragged out of the palace, weakly struggling against the soldiers dragging him by his arms. he was dropped at the feet of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], who held the torch out to him. He would drop the first torch."
 ayabani.3a:0 "Centuries of humiliation finally undone."

 ayabani.4.t:0 "Samgugtong-il"
 ayabani.4.d:0 "30 years ago, King Yeong Go died childless, and the Tamna Kingdom shattered. We have existed in a state of undeclared civil war ever since. But that ends now. Our army stands unparalleled. Our navy is prepared to face any challenge. The best and the brightest have rallied to our cause. There are no more plans left to finalize, and no more questions left to answer. The Three Kingdoms will be unified, no matter the cost. We will claim what is rightfully ours!"
 ayabani.4a:0 "Or we will die trying."

 ayabani.5.t:0 "Our Enemies Make for War"
 ayabani.5.d:0 "30 years ago, King Yeong Go died childless, and the Tamna Kingdom shattered. We have existed in a state of undeclared civil war ever since. But it seems that will soon come to an end. Our rivals have already made moves to restart the succession crisis. While we had hopes of doing so ourselves, we don't have many options left. We can either fight or denigrate ourselves to try and postpone it until we're ready. How shall we proceed?"
 ayabani.5a:0 "We have no choice. To arms!"
 ayabani.5b:0 "We aren't ready yet. Do whatever it takes to delay this."

 ayabani.6.t:0 "The Curse of the Mirror"
 ayabani.6.d:0 "Several days ago, a travelling Mudang visited the Royal Court. She claimed to have a message for The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] from [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] ancestors. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] decided to entertain this visit and met with her in private, but hasn't been the same since. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has begun compulsively destroying every mirror within sight, claiming that the Mudang had done something that ruined [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] face. Nobody else in the court has noticed anything wrong with [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] face and this point has been made several times, but the destruction of any reflective surface has continued nonetheless."
 ayabani.6a:0 "Okay Your Majesty, we'll get rid of all the mirrors for you..."

 ayabani.7.t:0 "The Traveler in White"
 ayabani.7.d:0 "Early this morning a man arrived outside the palace. He wore all white robes and sported a snappy white beard. When asked for his name he simply referred to himself as a traveler and asked for an audience with the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], which was reluctantly granted. The Traveler explained that he was a wandering mystic, who had travelled across the land spreading his good word to society after society. He was a practitioner of what he referred to as The Cult of Light. An ethos that sought to promote devotion, bravery, and sacrifice for the greater good. According to him, he had spent time at the courts of the Yan, the Ming, the Yamatai, and even the Old Kingdom of Tamna. And he was offering to teach us his ways as well. While there was no way of verifying anything the man said, some within the court seemed to be persuaded by his words. He said he would return in a few weeks to hear our response."
 ayabani.7a:0 "What an odd man"

 ayabani.8.t:0 "The Seer in Black"
 ayabani.8.d:0 "It has been a week since the Traveler in White left, and the entire time the court has been endlessly debating the merit of his words. Devotion, Bravery, and Sacrifice can be very helpful for a Kingdom seeking to expand, such as ours is. However, before any further discussion could take place a young man waltzed into the throne room. A pale man, he was dresse all in black. He bowed before the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and introduced himself simply as a Seer. He claimed to be a former apprentice of the Traveler in White, whom he had heard had recently visited our court. He claimed that what the Traveler preached was nothing but self serving lies. That he had done nothing but bring ruin to the societies he had visited. When one courtier tried to bring up that of the courts the Traveler visited only Tamna fell, the Seer kicked him in the shin and the had to be restrained before he could cause further harm. The Seer left quickly after that, warning us of grave consequences should we take the Traveler's offer."
 ayabani.8a:0 "...I'll be sure to keep that in mind."

 ayabani.9.t:0 "The Confrontation"
 ayabani.9.d:0 "The Throne Room was abuzz. The Traveler in White had returned. He bowed before the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], saying it was a pleasure to be back and asking if his advice had been heeded. Without warning, the Seer barged into the Throne Room, shoving past the guards. He asked if the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] was seriously considering taking the advice of a fraud whose words would bring nothing but ruin to the land. The Traveler simply smiled at the Seer and said it was good to see him again. The Seer didn't seem to share the sentiment, and if looks could kill the Traveler would have disintegrated on the spot. The room went quiet, everyone inside stopping to watch the two men stare each other down. Out of nowhere the Seer drew a dagger from inside his Hanbok. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] stood up just as quickly, held out [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] hand, and spoke."
 ayabani.9a:0 "This Traveler is a guest. Guards, please escort the Seer away."
 ayabani.9b:0 "I will not let my realm fall to chaos. Guards, escort the Traveler away."

 ayabani.10.t:0 "The Ascension of the Traveler"
 ayabani.10.d:0 "A couple of days after being taken from the court, the Seer vanished. Local fishermen claimed to have seen his body floating in a shipwreck of the coast of Wae, but nothing concrete was found. The Traveler, on the other hand, was quick to integrate himself into the Tamnan court. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] spent hours discussing all manner of things with him, and soon his teachings began to spread across the capital. But unfortunately, the Traveler seemingly had a higher calling. Without warning he vanished himself, his quarters still furnished from the day before. Having ascended to Godhood, he was quickly integrated into the Royal Pantheon, and the day of his ascension was declared a holy day."
 ayabani.10a:0 "Together in the Light"

 ayabani.11.t:0 "The Cult of the Seer"
 ayabani.11.d:0 "The Traveler in White was dead. Only a few days after having him removed from the court, the Seer left for a day trip and returned with the Traveler's head. After that, he had his way with the court. He spent hours with the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and the Royal family, teaching them of his strange philosophy. While the Royal family was hesitant to accept the teachings, the Seer was quickly approached by the military, who were enamored by his words. The Seer's teachings spread like a wildfire across the capital until he had his very own cult following. He began the construction of a pyramid in $CAPITAL$, a place for his students to congregate and spread his word. And just like that, he vanished. His students claimed he had ascended to Godhood and demanded the Royal family integreate him into the national pantheon. Without much of a choice, they obliged."
 ayabani.11a:0 "The Pyramid is quite nice if you give it a chance, I swear!"

##MISSIONs
 aya_navy_title:0 "To Conquer the Seas"
 aya_navy_desc:0 "The Old Kingdom was always conscious about maintainging a strong navy. With our origins in the island of Tamna, that is not surprising. But when the Old Kingdom fell, we began to focus far more on our holdings in Nihon and the navy fell to neglect. With war on the horizon, we must make sure our navy is strong enough to defeat our enemies."

 aya_merge_army_navy_title:0 "The Question of Command"
 aya_yamatai_support_desc:0 "An ever present concern of the coming war is that of logistics. As such, several low ranking military officers have put forth a siggestion: appointing our ruler as leader of the military."

 aya_unification_war_title:0 "The Great War of Unification"
 aya_unification_war_desc:0 "All of our preparation has led up to this moment. We have waited for 30 years for the right opportunity to fall into our lap. But we will wait no longer. The Kingdoms of Tamna will be united, and we will be the ones to do it!"

 aya_army_title:0 "The Grand Army of Tamna"
 aya_army_desc:0 "The Grand Army of Tamna was the principle fighting force of the Old Kingdom. If we are to take our rightful place as their heirs, we must make sure that our army is able to live up to what it once was. Officially restoring the Grand Army of Tamna will go a long way in ensuring that becomes a reality."

 tmn_econ_title:0 "Rebuilding the Economy"
 tmn_econ_desc:0 "The Great War of Reunification may have bound our kingdoms together, but the lingering economic effects still plague the realm. Entire villages were wiped out by marauding armies and one enterprising noble is 12000 Grain Coins in debt to Japanese moneylenders. Serious rebuilding efforts will have to be undertaken in order to ensure that our economy recovers. We may even need to call on the moneyed men of the realm to aid us. Only when the economy is thriving will our people be happy and healthy, after all."

 tmn_stalin_title:0 "Purge the Bureaucracy"
 tmn_stalin_desc:0 "Uniting the three kingdoms has caused an unfortunate side effect: the bureaucrats of all three kingdoms have begun to forge alliances. They know that the reforms we are undertaking put their careers at risk and hope that, if they can gain enough traction, they will be able to outlast the coming storm. They believe themselves to be faceless bean counters who blend into the woodwork. We must show them that they couldn't be more wrong right before we show them the door."

 tmn_nobles_title:0 "Reign in the Nobility"
 tmn_nobles_desc:0 "The thing that brought down the old kingdom, besides rampant corruption, nepotism in the army, overreliance on allies that no longer existed, and the lack of an heir, was cliques of nobles having their way with the countryside. These rampant abuses turned the people against the nobility and led to revolt after revolt, wwhich turned the army against the nobility. These past 30 years little has changed on that front. Until now. The nobles will no longer be allowed to abuse the people so directly. They must be curtailed."

 tmn_war_pacifism_title:0 "Declare War on Pacifism"
 tmn_war_pacifism_desc:0 "Priests across the realm celebrated the reunification of the kingdoms, as they believed it would bring an end to the era of militarism that began when the Old Kingdom fell. They have begun to preach their pacifist ways from village to village, lying to the people and claiming that they will never have to shoulder the burden of another war. This is an incredibly dangerous line of thinking. These priests must be reigned in and pacifism must be eradicated if we are to claim or rightful destiny."

 tmn_unbreakable_union_title:0 "Unbreakable Union"
 tmn_unbreakable_union_desc:0 "Some said that reunifying the Tamnan kingdoms was impossible. That we would sooner be swallowed up by the Japanese before we could ever work together again. They were swiftly executed to prevent such seditious ideas from spreading, but they have been proven wrong from beyond the grave. The Tamna Kingdoms are whole again. The Tamnan people are happy, healthy, prosperous, and willing to die for their [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. Now we may set our sights on the horizon. On the future of our Kingdom. And it looks very bright indeed."

 tmn_three_armies_title:0 "The Three Grand Armies"
 tmn_three_armies_desc:0 "The integration of our rival kingdoms have given our high command a rude awakening: we were not the only ones to attempt a restoration of the Grand Army. In fact, all three kingdoms had their own Grand Army. Now we have to deal with the fact that we have three different Grand Armies under our control. We will have to carefully navigate this issue if we do not want to hamstring our army in any future conflicts."

 tmn_trucebreak_title:0 "Breaking the Treaty of Settsu"
 tmn_trucebreak_desc:0 "In 1204 the Kingdom of Tamna, following their defeat in the siege of Kyoto, signed a treaty with the Japanese agreeing to withdraw from our occupied territories in exchange for peace with Yamatai. This put an end to the Tamnan Golden Age and the kingdom began to stagnate. If we are to undo the wrongs of the past, our first step should be to do away with this vile treaty. We will not allow Japanese barbarians to put a limit on our greatness!"

 tmn_cant_spell_chrysanthemum_title:0 "The Coronation"
 tmn_cant_spell_chrysanthemum_desc:0 "At long last the great city of Kyoto, and with it the Kingdom of Yamatai-koku, have fallen. We have finished what our ancestors started more than 200 years ago. We will celebrate this great victory by crowning our great King the King of Yamatai. With luck this may even convince the Japanese of the righteousness of our rule."

 tmn_ryu_title:0 "The Matter of Amishi"
 tmn_ryu_desc:0 "Securing the tribute of the Kingdom of Amishi in 1109 was the first expansion undertaken by the Old Kingdom without the help of the Kingdom of Goryeo. Amishi would remain subject to the Old Kingdom until the very moment it fractured, waiting until they were sure nobody would notice their declaration of independence. They were right to think that way, as in the chaos of the following decades almost no member of any of the three courts even bothered to try and subjugate them again. They would have been forgotten entirely had we not discovered trade manifests mentioning them in our sack of Kyoto. Now it is time to decide what to do about this renegade island."

 tmn_kuomintang_title:0 "The Northern Expedition"
 tmn_kuomintang_desc:0 "The people of northern Nihon have struggled against the Japanese for almost as long as we have. One could imagine this would make us kindred spirits. One would be wrong to imagine that. But we must not let the same vulgar prejudice that blinded the Japanese to the strength of the Ainu be our downfall. By conquering the Ainu we will cement oursevles as the rightful and undisputed rulers of this land. And we will pacify these tribes once and for all."

 tmn_nihon_title:0 "Conquerors of the Sun"
 tmn_nihon_desc:0 "In 1204 the Old Kingdom of Tamna was reduced to an irrelevant nation. Our existence was propped up by Goryeo, and the Japanese viewed us as nothing but freeloaders on their rightful territory. We were the laughingstock of the region. Now, Goryeo is long gone, and the Japanese have bent the knee to their rightful rulers. Our revenge has been swift, and it has been sweet. And now we stand as the undisputed Kings of Nihon."

 tmn_sos_title:0 "Rescuing our Brothers"
 tmn_sos_desc:0 "A century ago our closest ally, the Kingdom of Goryeo, was destroyed. Barbarian invaders came in from the north, murdering the king in cold blood and destroying a dynasty that had ruled for 400 years. While the old Kingdom managed to seize several border territories when the barbarian kingdom fell, the status quo has lasted for decades. We were powerless to stop the fall, but now we can undo this great mistake. With our territories in Korea secured we will laucnh a strike at the weak southern Khanates."

 tmn_mac_title:0 "Reclaiming the Capital"
 tmn_mac_desc:0 "With southern Korea secured, we can move on to greater targets. The Jalayrids, the descendants of the vile Dayan, have made Kaesong the capital of their Kingdom. It was the city where the Kingdom of Goryeo fell and where Dayan proclaimed himelf Khan of the Solonguns. This injustice, this mockery, cannot be allowed to continue. The Koreans of Kaesong cry for liberation, and we will answer. We will drive the Mongols from the old capital and restore it to its rightful rulers."

 tmn_wiry_title:0 "Up the Penninsula"
 tmn_wiry_desc:0 "The Capital, as well as the south, have been liberated. All that remains now is to eliminate the last vesitges of Mongol ruler over Korea. We will push all the way up to the border with the northern barbarians and ensure that not one Mongol soldier is left before us. Our ancestors demand it. Only then will our second greatest shame be truly avenged."

 tmn_need_title:0 "Seas of Gold"
 tmn_need_desc:0 "Even with its small size in comparison to our new realm, the Old Kingdom of Tamna was once a trade powerhouse. It served as a toll booth for any who attempted to enter into the Yellow Sea and trade with China and Goryeo. Now, with Korea under our control, we stand poised to grow even more wealthy than even our forefathers. We will control any and all trade coming in to Beijing until we can fill the seas with our gold."

 tmn_hoi4_title:0 "Resettlement Commission"
 tmn_hoi4_desc:0 "The penninsula may have been reclaimed and the Mongol Khans killed, but the fact remains that large parts of the penninsula are still occupied by tribals. To counter this, we will establish a new agency dedicated to driving the tribes out of our territory and resettling it with Korean exiles who fled the collapse, as well as enterprising Tamnans who wish for new opportunities."

 tmn_changbai_title:0 "Beyond the Changbai"
 tmn_changbai_desc:0 "Both Korea and Nihon have been secured, but all is not well. Barbarian tribes launch constant raids on our Korean territories. This threat cannot go unanswered. We will march our men through the Changbai mountains and secure ourselves a foothold in barbarian territory, through which we will pacify the entire region. The safety of our people shall be our top priority."

 tmn_frontier_title:0 "Taming the Frontier"
 tmn_frontier_desc:0 "The northern frontiers of the lands beyond the Amur are populated by sparse and disparate tribes. They have attempted to reach out to us several times, claiming they simply wish to facilitate trade and establish friendly relations. We see through their lies. While they are weak, they still represent a threat to our interests. We must ensure these tribes cannot join forces to threaten our borders. Only by pacifying them will they be rendered harmless."

 tmn_coast_title:0 "Conquering the Coast"
 tmn_coast_desc:0 "The various barbarian tribes along the coast present no threat to us at the moment. They have yet to adequately master seafaring. That does not mean they will not do so in the future, however. Our experience with Japanese pirates has taught us that threats from the sea cannot be taken lightly. We must dispersse these tribes before they can threaten our fragile ports."

 tmn_jesse_title:0 "A Saviour"
 tmn_jesse_desc:0 "The Mongolian and Yenisian Steppe is home to a number of faiths, chief among them being Shamanism like ours. However, it is also home to two far more interesting faiths: Christianity and Buddhism. With the lands of these barbarians under our control and our faith spreading more and more by the day, we have a chance to integrate one of these faiths into the Royal Pantheon."

 tmn_jade_title:0 "Throne of Jade and Light"
 tmn_jade_desc:0 "The ruling ideology of the Chinese elite has been the ideas of Confucius for centuries. While some have considered integrating him into the pantheon, two interesting alternatives have been suggested: China's Jade Emperor, and the prophet Mani worshipped by those in the south of China. Only one may be chosen, for it will be seen as an insult to the followers of the other. We must choose carefully which spirit to pray to."

 tmn_faith_title:0 "The Sun or the Bear"
 tmn_faith_desc:0 "One of the greatest strengths of our faith is its malleability. The spirits a believer prays to are, for the most part, up to the believer themselves. And now, with the islands of Nihon under our control, we have taken over land belonging to two different faiths. Integrating one of them into the pantheon of our royal family will go a long way in integrating the believers."

 tmn_amur_title:0 "Tigers of the Amur"
 tmn_amur_desc:0 "The barbarian tribes of the Amur have been pacified. From Naju to Albazin out people live in harmony. They are happy and safe, no longer having to worry about marauding bands of barbarians burning down their villages. Like the mighty tiger we have destroyed every foe before us and ushered in a new era of prosperity across our great land."

 tmn_heaven_title:0 "To Conquer Heaven"
 tmn_heaven_desc:0 "We have established ourselves as masters of Nihon, Korea, and the Amur. But we are not content with playing second fiddle to anyone. The Empire of China stands as a mockery of all who do not kowtow before the Chinese. We will stand for it no longer. In the name of all the people of the United Kingdoms and all who stand in opposition to the Mandate of Heaven."

 tmn_wall_title:0 "Along the Great Wall"
 tmn_wall_desc:0 "The Great Wall of China was built to keep barbarian invaders from entering China from the north. While it did not help against Guo Hong, or us, it serves as an excellent route for our armies on what territories to conquer next. With the Wall to our backs the people of northern China will have nowhere to run from our triumphant armies."

 tmn_river_title:0 "Like a Flooding River"
 tmn_river_desc:0 "The Yangtze River serves as both the lifeblood of northern China as well as a source of constant threat with its regular flooding. Like the Yangtze, our armies will flood across the land. We will annihilate all who oppose us and make sure that no civilization exists in this land without our permission."

 tmn_plains_title:0 "Central Plains War"
 tmn_plains_desc:0 "Central China's greatest weakness is the abundance of flat terrain. It is perfect for our armies to fight on. The north has been secured and the mandate broken, but our jon is not yet finished. We must sweep across the plains and drive the warlords into the sea, for such is our destiny made manifest."

 tmn_tno_title:0 "The Twin Pearls"
 tmn_tno_desc:0 "China has fallen to our armies, but one last prize remains unclaimed. The lands of Guangdong have been in the hands of disparate barbarian warlords for far too long. It would be far better for all parties, aside from the barbarian kings of course, if the land were to be under our control. These twin pearls of China must be ours."

 tmn_steppe_title:0 "Subjugating the Steppe"
 tmn_steppe_desc:0 "The tribes of the steppe were once feared warriors, barbarians capable of bringing down entire civilizations over a percieved slight. Guo Hong was quick to put them in their place, and they have yet to recover. The Khalkha tribes that occupy the Mongolian plateau are the weakest of the bunch, and would make for excellent subjects."

 tmn_mountain_title:0 "Moving the Mountains"
 tmn_mountain_desc:0 "Guo Hong's dispersal of barbarian tribes, while in principle a good idea, allowed barbarians from the north to take up residence in these newly unoccupied lands. The Yenisians chief among them. If we are to secure overlordship over the steppe these mountain-dwelling tribals must be dealt with. We cannot allow them to raid our newly pacified subjects."

 tmn_republic_title:0 "Breaking the Republics"
 tmn_republic_desc:0 "The presence of the Silk Road led to the rise of a great many republics in and around the city of Gaochang. It is an affront to all things good in this world. These barbarians, holding their so-called elections, act like it makes them our equals. They must be put in their place. They must be made to understand that adopting civility does not make them civilized."

 tmn_temujin_title:0 "Our own Khanate"
 tmn_temujin_desc:0 "Mongol chieftans often speak of a destiny denied to them. They claim that Guo Hong was only able to achieve his many feats due to timing, and a little bit of luck. We have once again proven them wrong. A century after Guo Hong nearly wiped them out the Mongols have been subjugated once more. They have been disgraceful in defeat, but we must be graceful in victory. We will proclaim ourselves as the new Khans of this land, based on the strength of our armies. There is, after all, much we can learn from our new subjects. It would be shame to waste it."

 tmn_empire_title:0 "The Empire of our Dreams"
 tmn_empire_desc:0 "Both Korea and Nihon have been secured, but all is not well. Barbarian tribes launch constant raids on our Korean territories. This threat cannot go unanswered. We will march our men through the Changbai mountains and secure ourselves a foothold in barbarian territory, through which we will pacify the entire region. The safety of our people shall be our top priority."

 tmn_taiwan_title:0 "The Eastern Expedition"
 tmn_taiwan_desc:0 "Conquering northern China has allowed us to learn of some of the more strange facets of life in the region. One of those is the Shanyue, a band of marauders based out of the island of Taiwan. We aren't sure if they're still around or not, but regardless there are things we can learn from them. By conquering them. We cannot allow them to raid our people, but we could put their knowledge to use against others."
