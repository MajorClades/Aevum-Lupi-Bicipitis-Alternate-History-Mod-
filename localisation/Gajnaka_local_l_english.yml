 gaj.1.desc:0 "Since the time before the rise of Islam and the arrival of Gou Hong, the Silesians had created a pact with our nation.\nThrough regulations and tariffs, mutual trade flowed between our nation from the far east of Serica to the North Sea, a pact that today reached the time for renewal."

 gaj.3.test:0 "Guo Hong's First Block"
 gaj.3.desc:0 "Having encountered little in the way of fortifications and having recently taken over the entire Serbian Empire, Guo Hong would face the first true bit of resistance from the turkic defenders of the fortified city of Osman.\nDespite the ferocity of the defenders, Guo Hong could benefit from Khitans Siege Masters and truly broke the city to rubble, only being stopped for two months from rampaging all over Eastern Europe.\nToday Osman stands a broken ruin of a past glory, but with sufficient technological mastery and proper investment by the ruling family of Osmanoglu, the fortified city has returned to what once withstood the might of a thousand armies!"
 gaj.3a:0 "The Tide has passed and the people have Rebuilt."

 gaj.4.test:0 "A Horse for a 1000 Horses"
 gaj.4.desc:0 "The Savasts are great horse riders and even greater supply runners, having been put to the test by the Mongol Regiments of Guo Hong.\nDefeated but not bested, the Savasts would eventually swear fealty to the Warlord and bring the rest of Eastern Europe to Guo on a silver platter.\nEven now as the Saxons loom over the latverian steppes, we have repurposed the city of Kurske as a perfect hub for training and movement of troops."

 gaj.6.test:0 "Time of Fear"
 gaj.6.desc:0 "The powerful landowner's heirs have started to petition the Sultan for a better cut of the late noble inheritance, some even starting to rouse up a local militia and mercenary companies.\nThe very legitimacy of the Sultan's power is now questioned by even the common folk that such a small event could spark such a disaster."
 gaj.6a:0 "Quiet this upstart!"

 gaj.7.test:0 "A Magnificient Fellow"
 gaj.7.desc:0 "The sound of broken chains rattling onto brick floor as the guards realize the disapperance of one notable prisoner.\nHow else would the death of a single man caused so much trouble, if not a sponsored rebellion and an intricate conspiracy.\nThe fugitive Suleiman has gone into hiding and now we must face his troops, while the peasantry has been riled up agaisnt the Sultan by promises of lessened taxes."
 gaj.7a:0 "Quite the Felon!"

 gaj.8.test:0 "Time of Courage"

 gaj.9.test:0 "Question of Workforce"

 gaj.10a:0 "Allow those who wish to donate and help those who cannot."
 gaj.10b:0 "Assume control of Clerical Dealings and ensure proper practices."
 gaj.10c:0 "May God have mercy upon your golden Soul."

 gaj.11.test:0 "Question of Nobility"
 gaj.11.desc:0 "Usually the Serican Nobility lords over the peasantry with increasing disgust.\nMany minor nobles suggest that the peasants will eventually revolt and destroy this carefully built system, unless changes are made; a couple of them suggest better pay for the serfs and servants.\nSome have the bravey to suggest diminishing the noble privileges of those who badly treat those beneath them, some have the gaul to suggest the complete end to Serfdom.\n\nWhat to do?"

 gaj.13b:0 "We should have a calmer approach."
