#####EVENTS

 gaj.1.test:0 "Silesian Pact of Trade"
 gaj.1.desc:0 "Since the time before the rise of Islam and the arrival of Gou Hong, the Silesians had created a pact with our nation.\nThrough regulations and tariffs, mutual trade flowed between our nation from the far east of Serica to the North Sea, a pact that today reached the time for renewal."
 gaj.1a:0 "Keep up the good work."
 gaj.1b:0 "Use it to upgrade the market."
 gaj.1c:0 "We have altered the deal."

 gaj.2.test:0 "War of the Frozen Fingers"
 gaj.2.desc:0 "In memory still frozen, mirror-like ice puddles form the old War of the Deef Flag, reminding us of the cost of conflicts in this snowy hellscape.\nAbandoning the current efforts to keep the Gorians at bay or keep pushing further?"
 gaj.2a:0 "This land isn't worth the blood of our people."
 gaj.2b:0 "We will make the very storm bleed!"

 gaj.3.test:0 "Guo Hong's First Block"
 gaj.3.desc:0 "Having encountered little in the way of fortifications and having recently taken over the entire Serbian Empire, Guo Hong would face the first true bit of resistance from the turkic defenders of the fortified city of Osman.\nDespite the ferocity of the defenders, Guo Hong could benefit from Khitans Siege Masters and truly broke the city to rubble, only being stopped for two months from rampaging all over Eastern Europe.\nToday Osman stands a broken ruin of a past glory, but with sufficient technological mastery and proper investment by the ruling family of Osmanoglu, the fortified city has returned to what once withstood the might of a thousand armies!"
 gaj.3a:0 "The Tide has passed and the people have Rebuilt."

 gaj.4.test:0 "A Horse for a 1000 Horses"
 gaj.4.desc:0 "The Savasts are great horse riders and even greater supply runners, having been put to the test by the Mongol Regiments of Guo Hong.\nDefeated but not bested, the Savasts would eventually swear fealty to the Warlord and bring the rest of Eastern Europe to Guo on a silver platter.\nEven now as the Saxons loom over the latverian steppes, we have repurposed the city of Kurske as a perfect hub for training and movement of troops."
 gaj.4a:0 "Be careful,"A good night in Kurske" means getting kicked by a Donkey."

 gaj.5.test:0 "Party Rocked"
 gaj.5.desc:0 "During a feast at the Sultan's Palace, a fight broke out between a powerful landowner and a smaller noble.\nLeading to a honor duel that left the higher noble deceased before the Sultan could be alerted of it taking place.\nThe smaller noble was stripped of his titles and senteced to the dungeons, hopefully this is the last we hear about him."
 gaj.5a:0 "No one will hear the name Suleiman ever again."

 gaj.6.test:0 "Time of Fear"
 gaj.6.desc:0 "The powerful landowner's heirs have started to petition the Sultan for a better cut of the late noble inheritance, some even starting to rouse up a local militia and mercenary companies.\nThe very legitimacy of the Sultan's power is now questioned by even the common folk that such a small event could spark such a disaster."
 gaj.6a:0 "Quiet this upstart!"

 gaj.7.test:0 "A Magnificient Fellow"
 gaj.7.desc:0 "The sound of broken chains rattling onto brick floor as the guards realize the disapperance of one notable prisoner.\nHow else would the death of a single man caused so much trouble, if not a sponsored rebellion and an intricate conspiracy.\nThe fugitive Suleiman has gone into hiding and now we must face his troops, while the peasantry has been riled up agaisnt the Sultan by promises of lessened taxes."
 gaj.7a:0 "Quite the Felon!"

 gaj.8.test:0 "Time of Courage"
 gaj.8.desc:0 "The rebellion has been almost squashed, now is only time until Suleiman will play it's cards and attack us with all he can muster!\nHe claims he has the right to rule as his family ruled before the arrival of the armies of Guo Hong, but the time has passed and like all others shall learn that the hard way!"
 gaj.8a:0 "Be prepared you fiend!"

 gaj.9.test:0 "Question of Workforce"
 gaj.9.desc:0 "The many workers and serfs of our country demand something be done to restrict the merchants hold over all monetary comsumption and tariff, any kind of concessions however will definitely cost us some favors among the mercantile class, but not doing so will anger the populace.\n\nWhat to do?"
 gaj.9a:0 "Allow for minor contracts and deliver better payment."
 gaj.9b:0 "Ban the use of long term Contracts with the lower classes."
 gaj.9c:0 "Assume control and direction of the Guilds."

 gaj.10.test:0 "Question of Faith"
 gaj.10.desc:0 "In respect of all Muslim Scriptures, the country operates well enough in the confines of dogma and faith, however everyone may not agree on how well the country is being run from the ground up.\nThe mercyful among us have requested that religious minorities be not punished and even allowed higher position of power, others have shown the desire to donate major parts of their wealth to the betterment of the state.\n\nWhat to do?"
 gaj.10a:0 "Allow those who wish to donate and help those who cannot."
 gaj.10b:0 "Assume control of Clerical Dealings and ensure proper practices."
 gaj.10c:0 "May God have mercy upon your golden Soul."

 gaj.11.test:0 "Question of Nobility"
 gaj.11.desc:0 "Usually the Serican Nobility lords over the peasantry with increasing disgust.\nMany minor nobles suggest that the peasants will eventually revolt and destroy this carefully built system, unless changes are made; a couple of them suggest better pay for the serfs and servants.\nSome have the bravey to suggest diminishing the noble privileges of those who badly treat those beneath them, some have the gaul to suggest the complete end to Serfdom.\n\nWhat to do?"
 gaj.11a:0 "A couple of coins more at day, keeps the guillotine away."
 gaj.11b:0 "A Bad Apple spoils the bunch."
 gaj.11c:0 "Buy and free the serfs to work directly under the Crown."

 gaj.12.test:0 "Seal the Deal"
 gaj.12.desc:0 "Adjusting for all the fair people that live under my rule, today will be remember as an historical date for our country!"
 gaj.12a:0 "A fair law for a fair people."
