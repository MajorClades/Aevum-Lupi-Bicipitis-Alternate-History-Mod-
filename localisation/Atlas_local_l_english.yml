 atlas.1.test: "Legacy of the Maurian Incursions"
 atlas.1.desc: "The lands beyond the Atlas mountains have never been the richest, just north of the great Sahara desert. They have recently fallen on even harder times, though. Just after the fall of the African Empire, the kingdoms of Ille, Uvrei and Borteni declared their independence. The Maurians, however, eyed the lands of the Atlas with greedy eyes, and so launched a never-ending series of raids on us, looting our villages, and carting off all wealth back to their citadel in the north. Recently, however, political chaos in the Maurian court has put an end to the endless raids. We must sieze the opportunity and unite before it is too late."
