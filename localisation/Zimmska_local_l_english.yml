#Events
 zimmska.1.test: "Integration of the Slasmeri Triangle"
 zimmska.1.desc: "The Slasmeri Triangle has never been the most official or close organization, with conflict between members common and inefficiency rampant. We shall offer to further integrate our nations together, for greater prosperity. Under [Root.GetName] of course."
 zimmska.1a: "Together, for prosperity"

 zimmska.2.test: "An Offer We Can't Refuse"
 zimmska.2.desc: "[ZL5.GetName] has offered to integrate the Slasmeri triangle closer, in order to bring more prosperity for all of us."
 zimmska.2a: "Together, for prosperity"
 zimmska.2b: "Well, I'm refusing it!"

 zimmska.3.test: "A Capital for Zimmska"
 zimmska.3.desc: "With the unification of Zladinia under our banner, the question of where to put the capital has arisen. Many have spoken out abour how [Root.Capital.GetName] is simple not fit to be the capital for a nation such as ours. A number of options have presented themselves, and it is up to us to choose where we shall place the center of our nation."
 zimmska.3a: "Oreple, home of conquerers"
 zimmska.3b: "Azeri, the old capital"
 zimmska.3c: "Brjika, the staple port"
 zimmska.3d: "Berezhangrod, the city of the sea"
 zimmska.3e: "Rommerskoje, metropolis of Silesia"
 zimmska.3f: "[Root.Capital.GetName] is fine"

 zimmska.4.test: "The Anglish March"
 zimmska.4.desc: "After the conquest of Saxo-Anglia, our state has been particularly overextended, and exposed in the south. This has led to a variety of problems, one of which is that our Anglish subjects have become particularly rowdy, and unwilling to submit to our benevolent rule. A proposal has come up, which should solve all of these issues. We can create a semi-independent march in the region, governed by locals, to alleviate administrative stress and provide a bulwark in the south."
 zimmska.4a: "It would help to have a subject govern the region"
 zimmska.4b: "No, direct rule from [Root.Capital.GetName]!"
 
 zimmska.5.test: "Pierogies"
 zimmska.5.desc: "A strange new crop has been discovered in Rausulia, potatoes. This small root vegetable has seemingly become popular among the peasants due to it's hardiness and ability to be grown anywhere. It has been used recently to create a peculiar sort of dumpling, which has taken [Root.GetName] by storm. They call it a 'Pierogi'."
 zimmska.5a: "Delicious!"

 zimmska.6.test: "Slavery in Fiorita"
 zimmska.6.desc: "As the colonization of Fiorita continues, an economic turn has happened. As the triangle trade continues, many plantation owners in the region are opting to buy Libyan slaves, rather than use indentured servants like in the past. This pecular institution may be abhorrent to some, but it is proven it makes money."
 zimmska.6a: "Ok"

 zimmska.7.test: "The Slasmeri Triangle"
 zimmska.7.desc: "The Slasmeri Triangle is both an area of the Slasmeri Sea and a trade alliance between the nations of Brjika, Danrik, and Ruokoto. This mercantile alliance has brought us wealth since 1273, when our nations first allied. This alliance is sure to prosper for years to come!"
 zimmska.7a: "I like money"
