##BOKKMAK

 ALB_BOOKMARK: "Aevum Lupi Bicipitis £aevumlupibicipitis£"
 ALB_BOOKMARK_DESC: "As migrations tore the world asunder following the collapse of Rome, opportunistic rulers from across europe moved to stake their claim. In Italy, The Holy Italian Empire stands. In the east, Rhomania survives and finds the true faith in Islam. In Gallia, Soxony clings to life against the barbarian onslaught. In Germania, the Pruthians move to unify all Germans. And in Zladinia, the heirs of Zimmska race to reunite. Who shall survive in the age of the two-headed wolf?"

 WESTERN_DAWN_BOOKMARK: "Western Dawn £western_dawn£"
 WESTERN_DAWN_BOOKMARK_DESC: "Iberia in 1444 lies divided, war-torn, and yet hopeful. As the states of Spania and Burgundia finish the conflict they started nearly 140 years ago, the nations of Raklion and Bettia look west, to the great unknown. The nations of Iberia are the best positioned to take advantage of the age of exploration that is soon to come, and the best candidates to become future world powers. Take control of any of them, and make your mark on history."

 SCIONS_OF_AFRICA: "Scions of Africa £scions_of_africa£"
 SCIONS_OF_AFRICA_DESC: "The land of Africa has lay broken and defeated, ever since the collapse of the African Empire. The kingdom of Aldabba is the most legitimate successor, controlling the imperial capital of the same name. However, the other nations of the region are also poised to possibly restore the empire. The kingdom of Mauria is looking west, towards the soon to be discovered lands of Rausulia. Finally, the Berbers of the Atlas mountains are becoming tired of the endless raids and invasions, and may untie and strike out against the land that has wronged them."

 ALB_BOOKMARK_JONGWA: "Age of Princes £jongwa_bookmark£"
 ALB_BOOKMARK_JONGWA_DESC: "When the Yan proclaimed themselves the Celestial Emperor, the Han princes and magnates south of the river banded together to resists the new emperor, not knowing that only four out of eleven fiefdoms would survive the onslaught of barbarians pouring down upon the south, harsher than the Yellow River floods. Raise the banner of the Sima or Zhuge clan and restore their rule, expel the barbarians from Jongwa as the Liu Clan of Song, pledge your allegiance to the mighty Yan Empire, or forge a new homeland in Jongwa as one of the barbarian tribes."

 HIE_BOOKMARK: "Holy Italian Empire £HIE_bookmark£"
 HIE_BOOKMARK_DESC: "When Thela, son of Odoacer, was crowned emperor of the Romans by the Pope, it sparked a new age for Italy. It was the birth of the Holy Italian Empire, the now-decentralized state that rules over all of Italy and it's surroundings. Recently, the Molisian dynasty has secured the holy crown for themselves in a radical shift of power away from the north. Additionally, discontent between the Pope and Emperor has been growing, particularly over the matter of investiture and papal landholding withing the empire. Now, more than ever, the heart of Europe and the eternal city is a powderkeg waiting to blow."

 BIONO_BOOKMARK: "§OBattle for Biono§! £battle_for_biono£"
 BIONO_BOOKMARK_DESC: "Almost a thousand years ago, the norsemen sought refuge from the fires of Ragnarok in the green and pleasant land of Biono. Unfortunately for them, the Brittanians and Celts were already there, and wouldn't go down without a fight. Brittania, under Rex Brittanicum Arcturus, resisted the Swedish onslaught, but his heirs wouldn't be so lucky. The Scottish struggle against the Belgian pirates, and the Picts must fend off Zladinian advances. Meanwhile, the Swedes and Ganden Union are soon to come to blows. Biono is a free-for-all, and it is not yet determined who might claim the title of 'Lord of the Isles' for themselves."

 TURAN_BOOKMARK: "§OHeirs of Hong§! £heirs_of_hong£"
 TURAN_BOOKMARK_DESC: "'One thousand years ago, this land was populated by reindeer herders squatting in burnt out ruins. Our people took this blank tapestry and wove it into a masterpiece.' - Kuchug Honogly, Sultan of Gajnaka.\n'The barbarians of Valtea are numerous and savage. General Xiao has managed his land so poorly that to enter it would be to willingly walk into a trap.' - Dahe Duolo, General of Qidan.\nEastern Europe has always been a land of many peoples. First came the Burtasids and the Chuvash, and with them came tribes and a new name: Turuk-El, the land of the Turks. The fall of the Burtasids led to the rise of the Honogly, and the Turks prospered under their rule for 300 years. Guo Hong's invasion shattered Gajnaka and brought in thousands of new tribes calling the region their home. Will the Turks be able to unite against a common enemy? Or will Guo Hong's dream live on?"
