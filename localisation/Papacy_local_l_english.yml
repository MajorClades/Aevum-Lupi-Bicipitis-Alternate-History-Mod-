#EVENTS
 papacy.1.t:0 "Coronation of [Emperor.Monarch.GetName]"
 papacy.1.d:0 "Today the coronation of [Emperor.Monarch.GetName], ruler of [Emperor.GetName], shall begin preparations.\nUnless the Holy Father has anything to say about the newly elected heir to the Holy Italian Empire?"
 papacy.1a:0 "For a prosperous Empire and a brighter tomorrow!"
 papacy.1b:0 "You are not Worthy!"

 papacy.2.t:0 "The Papal Refusal"
 papacy.2.d:0 "The Pope has refused to adorn your head with the Holy Crown of the Empire, this has not reached the peasantry and is only known to the electors and some cardinals.\nIt will be wise to remind the Pope who rules around here."
 papacy.2a:0 "Is the coin more powerful then faith?"
 papacy.2b:0 "We can surely find a more peaceful solution."
 papacy.2c:0 "I Am The Pope!"
 papacy.2d:0 "Show him who he's against."

 papacy.3.t:0 "Rules for Thee"
 papacy.3.d:0 "Celibacy for the clergy is not strictly enforced as it is not a rule for most priests, until today.\nFrom now on all Lucanian priests shall take vows of Celibacy with no exceptions."
 papacy.3a:0 "With no exceptions, under God's watchful eyes."
 papacy.3b:0 "Well, some exceptions."

 papacy.4.t:0 "The Imperial Refusal"
 papacy.4.d:0 "The Imperial Heir has seeminly rejected our refusal to have a coronation, however there are plenty of ways we could be convinced to give them the crown."
 papacy.4a:0 "Yes, it is."
 papacy.4b:0 "A little more power for me."
 papacy.4c:0 "I said 'You are not Worthy!'."

 papacy.9.t:0 "Faithful Legates"
 papacy.9.d:0 "The faith of the Empire is paramount to its existence, the Church has saved the people from the worst of the barbarians that destroyed Rome, but in doing so it was limited. We can use our influence in the Empire to support or not its survival in this modern age."
 papacy.9a:0 "The Empire and the Church can coexist."
 papacy.9b:0 "The Church exists where the Faithful are."

 papacy.10.t:0 "Family Troubles"
 papacy.10.d:0 "Born Giacomo Baglioni, third son of the Dux of Persiano, encouraged to take the church's robes but now a Pope. It would be another day like the others, but his older brother has not survived the illness, leaving the Duxy of Persiano to his niece. A bright but naive lady which needs the guidance of her only living relative to survive the brutality of the Empire's Game of Thrones; in spite of the official treaties with the Emperor, the Pope doesn't own land outside the 'Patrimony of Saint Luke', but every law has its loopholes."
 papacy.10a:0 "I'm the Voice of God, and you're the Voice of the Pope."
 papacy.10b:0 "I shall allow her the Temporal Duties."

 papacy.11.t:0 "The Long Voyage To Heaven"
 papacy.11.d:0 "Despite much distance between the two empires, there is no reason to leave the Eastern Empire without representation to the faith, while they already know of Christ, their knowledge is entirely heretical and heathen. We shall prepare an expedition of missionaries to the so called Heavenly Kingdom, or at least find someone that will listen."
 papacy.11a:0 "A small entourage, hope they make it."
 papacy.11b:0 "Send them on a relative comfortable itinerary."
 papacy.11c:0 "Spare no coins, send the missionaries with all amenities."

 papacy.12.t:0 "The Missionaries of the West"
 papacy.12.d:0 "Some missionaries from the West have arrived speaking of their Lord and their Heaven, of which we already know. But there are many other offerings they bring which we are more than delighted to see, exotic goods and exotic books. We could trade more spiritual matters later."
 papacy.12a:0 "I believe in this new Heaven."
 papacy.12b:0 "You are welcomed but not encouraged."
 papacy.12c:0 "We will not entertain the very idea."

 papacy.13.t:0 "The Broken Faith"
 papacy.13.d:0 "Ain't nobody going to read this."
 papacy.13a:0 "Okay."
 papacy.13b:0 "Nah."

 papacy.14.t:0 "Records, Answers and Inquisitions"
 papacy.14.d:0 "The Inquisition is the most powerful tool to understand our enemies, those that aren't followers of the true faith; the Inquisitor is a really important job in the safekeeping of the church, and they are chosen wisely. But many of them are clearly taking their institution too far, it could be the case to ensure that no inquisitor gets too powerful by limiting their powerbase or we could make the Inquisition a permanent and public part of the Church."
 papacy.14a:0 "Limitless Authority, Limited Patience."
 papacy.14b:0 "Redistribute the power more evenly."

 papacy.15.t:0 "The Smothered Phoenix"
 papacy.15.d:0 "The enemies of God are at the walls of our cities, pushing the faithful to certain doom, cruelty and bloodshed are everywhere. May God help us."

 papacy.15b:0 "We will not be Denied our Divine Right!"
