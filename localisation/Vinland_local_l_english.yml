Those who were beaten in war were forced to submit to the rule of their conquerors.\nIn time this practive grew larger and larger, even among the locals, with direct effect on the Allthing. Where once Nobles and the common folk would gather, now only those with more power and land remain.\nIf their power continues to grow, they may deem the crown a mere obstacle in their path, to control them, their land must be confiscated and their slaves freed."

 fjal.21.test:0 "Come Hel or High Water"
 fjal.21.desc:0 "The weather is merely a test of spirit to our expert soldiers and our ships can traverse storms with ease, or so we want them to be.\nThe real obstacle is the limitations that a nation must budget its expenses accordingly. Where would we put our monetary effort towards our marines, our naval designs or maybe we should be more pragmatic?"
 fjal.21a:0 "The Chosens of the Sea."
 fjal.21b:0 "Our ships blessed by the Gods."
