#####EVENTS

 yamat.1.t:0 "The Young Prince's Birthday"
 yamat.1.d:0 "The death of the King and his first heir has led us to concede a temporary peace with the northern barbarians, while having to deal with the little prince whims.\nTo ensure that the prince isn't in any danger, his birthday will be celebrated privately in a hidden location, with most of the high command and plenty of guards.\nThe prince has ordered the birthday to be a grand spectacle with fireworks and sweets."
 yamat.1a:0 "The Great Commander protects the Little Dragon."

 yamat.2.t:0 "A Bright Birthday"
 yamat.2.d:0 "During the night a great explosion is heard even in nearby villages, as smokes billows, the palace where the prince's birthday was being celebrated is engulfed in flames.\nThe following day, after securing the prince was healthy, a count of the survivors is held; many were fortunate enough to leave the palace as soon as the explosion was heard but the legendary general Yuuichirou wasn't among them.\nPlenty are now under cures for severe burns and many of them haven't survived them."
 yamat.2a:0 "Who could cause such a disaster?"

 yamat.3.t:0 "Investigation and Recovery"
 yamat.3.d:0 "The remains of the palace have been thoroughly explored and investigated to understand what happened that night, while many clues point to the fireworks that were meant to be used, the soot keeps all secrets for now.\nSpy work from the neighboring countries has already been blamed regardless of the truth of the matter.\nOn good news, the royal doctor has managed to save an armored survivor, found under debris and soot; still heavily scarred and with coarse voice, the great general can still lead a war even if he doesn't show up on the battlefield."
 yamat.3a:0 "Well come back, General!"
 yamat.3b:0 "Wait. Who is really under the bandages?"

 yamat.4.t:0 "The enemy of our Enemy..."
 yamat.4.d:0 "Despite the difficulties of the work of a spy, many pride themselves in the quality and secrecy of their acts.\nTo let no one know they have been the true bloody hand of the killer, a ghost or a shadow.\nBut one must also know when to leave at opportune times, like when a naive prince launches a firework that wildly flies into all others causing further escalation of fires, one's first thoughts should be running away."
 yamat.4a:0 "...Is themselves."

 yamat.5.t:0 "The Last Orders"
 yamat.5.d:0 "As the great General lays dying on their bed, the flames of long ago still haunt their body and now will finally claim their soul.\nThe truth however doesn't die with the general, the lover of Yuuichirou was saved by his armor and the royal doctor that told 'he' survived was her father.\nThe revelation shocks most of the high command, but some were made privy to the situation by the 'general' herself.\nIt stands to either reveal it to the public or keep the notion that tactical acumen is learned rather than born with."
 yamat.5a:0 "The Great General's last Lesson."
 yamat.5b:0 "A Man dies only once."

 yamat.6.t:0 "Pacification of the South"

 yamat.7.t:0 "Pacification of the North"
 yamat.7.d:0 "While the years of occupation have gone by and all resistance has ceased, we have finally defeated once and for all the Ezo menace. Their people have forgotten their old traditions and have now understand our superiority."

 yamat.8.t:0 "Hegemon of the Sunrise Islands"
 yamat.8.d:0 "Crowning achievement of our tenacity and unity as a nation that we have conquered the entirety of the major island. However, the true test of power begins now as villages and nobles cry as new laws and decrees are set in motion to administrate the land."
 yamat.8a:0 "Glory to the Kamui!"
 yamat.8b:0 "Glory to the Kami!"

 yamat.9.t:0 "The Northern Shogunate"
 yamat.9.d:0 "While the land of the barbarians are ripe for exploitation, we have run into a major logistical problems.\nThe island of Hokkaido is less developed and therefore harder to send troops and administrate, but we could create a special position to deal with the wild land. A Commander-in-Chief of the Expeditionary Force against the Barbarians will be granted full freedom to run Hokkaido as he pleases, for as long as the island takes to be pacified.\n Otherwise we could simply comb the entire island with as many troops as we can muster and end this matter quickly."
 yamat.9a:0 "Establish the Shogunate."
 yamat.9b:0 "A sacrifice they are willing to make."

 yamat.10.t:0 "Promise Kept"
 yamat.10.d:0 "Honorable people such as ourselves will gladly give our word and kept it.\nThe Koreans, grateful as they are, will return to their homeland, under our protection."

 yamat.11.d:0 "The Tamnan Empire of old has finally ended, its descendants are in chains or subject to us.\nWe have full authority to do want we please with their destiny."
 yamat.11a:0 "Settle them back home."
 yamat.11b:0 "Settle them back home."
 yamat.11c:0 "Bring them to the colonies."

 yamat.12.t:0 "Pirates and Treasures"
 yamat.12.d:0 "As we have mostly full control of the Heaveanly Nihon, we also have plenty of coastlines to protect. Pirates and other nation's navies could strike at any moment, we could send an expedition to control the nearby sea and map the entire coastline if necessary."
 yamat.12a:0 "A map would be incredibly useful."
 yamat.12b:0 "More land for us."

 yamat.13.t:0 "A Land of Mana and Taboo"
 yamat.13.d:0 "We have followed the winds and the people of these islands are in an unstable situation where none can reach supremacy over the others. But we could help any of them at the right price. Which one should we help?"
 yamat.13a:0 "This one."
 yamat.13b:0 "This one?"

 yamat.15a:0 "Your land, My land."
 yamat.15b:0 "We claim all of it."

 yamat.16.t:0 "Finance An Easy Landing"
 yamat.16.d:0 "A port on the great continent will surely come handy in case of a full scale invasion of the Empire of China, but capturing one could prove difficult or costly.\nInstead we could simply buy it or buy some land and built it ourselves.\nAn opportunity has recently revealed itself in [668.GetName]: what should we do?"
 yamat.16a:0 "Buy the land."
 yamat.16b:0 "We could just take it."

 yamat.17.t:0 "Proposal of Land Acquisition"
 yamat.17.d:0 "The [KM6.GetName] want to buy land on the coastline of [668.GetName], how do we answer?"
 yamat.17a:0 "Let them buy it."
 yamat.17b:0 "Absolutely not."

 yamat.18.t:0 "Government of Chinese Submission"
 yamat.18.d:0 "The Heavenly Middle Kingdom has always had an air of superiority and claim each and every single other country to be inferiors. We have reclaimed the name of Yamato, but we have not forgotten their dismisal of our abilities and know they will surely understand."
 yamat.18a:0 "They shall be named 'Wa'."
 yamat.18b:0 "Heaven shall know our prowess."

 yamat.19.t:0 "Our Ambitions and Intentions"
 yamat.19.d:0 "The doors to the Heavens are open and we are invited to partake in all there is, whatever the host wants it or not.\nWe could take all we can and simply leave them with the dust but what kind of guest would we be if we did that?"
 yamat.19a:0 "Secure the Heavenly Tribute."
 yamat.19b:0 "We will rule as true Heavenly Kings."

 yamat.20.t:0 "The Art of War"
 yamat.20.d:0 "Long and difficult is the art of winning without fighting but to try is the way of a true leader. The wisdom of the past clashes with the power of the future, where training is beaten by thought. What is a warrior to do?"
 yamat.20a:0 "Pray to the Kami of War!"
 yamat.20b:0 "War is human-made and human-won."

 yamat.1000.t:0 "Weigh our Position"
 yamat.1000.d:0 "Each side wants more and more power but only we can decide which get anything!"
 yamat.1000a:0 "Tip the Army."
