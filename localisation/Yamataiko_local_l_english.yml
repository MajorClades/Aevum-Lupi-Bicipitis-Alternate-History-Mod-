#####EVENTS

 yamat.1.t:0 "The Young Prince's Birthday"
 yamat.1.d:0 "The death of the King and his first heir has led us to concede a temporary peace with the northern barbarians, while having to deal with the little prince whims.\nTo ensure that the prince isn't in any danger, his birthday will be celebrated privately in a hidden location, with most of the high command and plenty of guards.\nThe prince has ordered the birthday to be a grand spectacle with fireworks and sweets."
 yamat.1a:0 "The Great Commander protects the Little Dragon."

 yamat.2.t:0 "A Bright Birthday"
 yamat.2.d:0 "During the night a great explosion is heard even in nearby villages, as smokes billows, the palace where the prince's birthday was being celebrated is engulfed in flames.\nThe following day, after securing the prince was healthy, a count of the survivors is held; many were fortunate enough to leave the palace as soon as the explosion was heard but the legendary general Yuuichirou wasn't among them.\nPlenty are now under cures for severe burns and many of them haven't survived them."
 yamat.2a:0 "Who could cause such a disaster?"

 yamat.3.t:0 "Investigation and Recovery"
 yamat.3.d:0 "The remains of the palace have been thoroughly explored and investigated to understand what happened that night, while many clues point to the fireworks that were meant to be used, the soot keeps all secrets for now.\nSpy work from the neighboring countries has already been blamed regardless of the truth of the matter.\nOn good news, the royal doctor has managed to save an armored survivor, found under debris and soot; still heavily scarred and with coarse voice, the great general can still lead a war even if he doesn't show up on the battlefield."
 yamat.3a:0 "Well come back, General!"
 yamat.3b:0 "Wait. Who is really under the bandages?"

 yamat.4.t:0 "The enemy of our Enemy..."
 yamat.4.d:0 "Despite the difficulties of the work of a spy, many pride themselves in the quality and secrecy of their acts.\nTo let no one know they have been the true bloody hand of the killer, a ghost or a shadow.\nBut one must also know when to leave at oppurtune times, like when a naive prince launches a firework that wildly flies into all others causing further escalation of fires, one's first thoughts should be running away."
 yamat.4a:0 "...Is themselves."

 yamat.5.t:0 "The Last Orders"
 yamat.5.d:0 "As the great General lays dying on their bed, the flames of long ago still haunt their body and now will finally claim their soul.\nThe truth however doesn't die with the general, the lover of Yuuichirou was saved by his armor and the royal doctor that told 'he' survived was her father.\nThe revelation shocks most of the high command, but some where made privy of the situation by the 'general' herself.\nIt stands to either reveal it to the public or keep the notion that tactical acumen is learned rather than born with."
 yamat.5a:0 "The Great General's last Lesson."
 yamat.5b:0 "A Man dies only once."
