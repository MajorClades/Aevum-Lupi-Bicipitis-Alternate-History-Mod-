 iberia.2.test: "The Matter of the Goths"
 iberia.2.desc: "As the conquest of Gothia continues, the question of the nature of our rule in the region has presented itself. The Cotians are a hardy and independent people, and it shall be hard to integrate them. Therefore, granting them limited self-rule would relax the strain on our administration. However, the task of integrating them may lead to great benefits and a more cohesive society."
 iberia.2a: "Grant them self-rule"
 iberia.2b: "Integrate them into our administration"

 iberia.3.test: "The City of [224.GetName]"
 iberia.3.desc: "[224.GetName] has always been an important city, beginning as a Greek colony and eventually becoming the Roman city of Hispalis. It would even grant the peninsula it's name, Hispania. However, after the Vandal sack of the city is lost some relevance, but we have restored it. It might even be a good place to put our new capital."
 iberia.3a: "It would make a fine capital!"

He made contact with the local kingdoms of the islands and established Raklionne dominion over them fully. Now that we are pushing to explore further, Banrik's son has asked for our patronage to go further, to chart the route his father took on his legendary voyage west, and to go further."
 iberia.4a: "I'll take that deal!"
 iberia.4b: "It is not worth it"

 iberia.5.test: "The Expedition Sets Forth"
 iberia.5.desc: "It is time. The three ships of Banrik's expedition sit in the harbor, throngs of merchants and sailors surrounding it. Goods are carted in, the crew says their goodbyes to their families, supplies are counted, and all prepare to partake in what could potentially be one of the world's most important journeys."
 iberia.5a: "Good Luck!"

 iberia.6.test: "A Landing in Cape Verde"
 iberia.6.desc: "Great news from Banrik II's expedition! They have discovered a small archipelago strategically placed by the coast of Lybia. Seeing as it is relatively close to our nation, we were able to recieve word. We might be able to claim this virgin land for ourselves, if we act fast."
 iberia.6a: "Establish a colony at once!"

 iberia.7.test: "Banrik II's Expedition Returns"
 iberia.7.desc: "Glorious news! Banrik II has returned! He brings news of a verdant new world, ripe for the taking. It's people are simple and easily subjugated, and he was able to court some goodwill with them. The land of Rausulia is ripe for the taking, and we shall be the first ones there."
 iberia.7a: "Splendid!"

 iberia.8.test: "The Pormane Question"
 iberia.8.desc: "The city of Pormane has served as a haven for the Jewish people throughout the centuries. However, with our new state we must decide what to do with them. Do we give in to the moderates and walk a path of tolerance and understanding, or do we give in to the hardliners and expel them from our lands, once and for all."
 iberia.8a: "Patronize them."
 iberia.8b: "Send in the inquisition."

 iberia.9.test: "Jews Arrive from Pormane"
 iberia.9.desc: "The Jewish people expelled from the city of Pormane have arrived in our nation. Shall we allow them to settle?"
 iberia.9a: "Allow them to settle in [alb_jewish_destination_province.GetName]."
 iberia.9b: "They may not stay here."

 iberia.10.test: "The Focus of the Royal Council"
 iberia.10.desc: "The time has come - the king shall assemble the royal council. Delegates meet, papers are collected, and all brace for a long session ahead."
 iberia.10a: "Direct them to focus on administration."
 iberia.10b: "Have them focus on diplomacy."
 iberia.10c: "More investment into our military is needed."
