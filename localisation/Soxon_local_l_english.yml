#####EVENTS

 soxony.1.test:0 "War, what is it good for?"
 soxony.1.desc:0 "Disaster in Soxony! A failed war against the Holy Italian Empire has left Soxony in shambles, with more territorial concessions being given and Occitania forcing it's autonomy upon us! The various Sygirdoms of Soxony are looking at gallic lands with hungry eyes, and [SO0.Monarch.GetTitle] [SO0.Monarch.GetName] has been doing nothing about it. The empire is in crisis, and drastic measures must be done to save it."
 soxony.1a:0 "We will not fall like the Roman Empire!"

 soxony.2.test:0 "Sygirian Revolt"
 soxony.2.desc:0 "The difficult choice is upon us. We must choose whether to go our own way or stick with the soxon empire; to leave means independence, but will most likely lead to a war with Soxony. Staying with them will please them, but we shall remain a subject likely in perpetuity."
 soxony.2a:0 "We must fight for our freedom!"
 soxony.2b:0 "Being a sygirdom is nice, actually"

 soxony.3.test:0 "Old Man Yells at Clouds"
 soxony.3.desc:0 "The early onset of insanity in the young prince would spell the disaster for the Soxonic crown, led by loyal and capable generals but undermined by impossibile tasks. This is further complicated by the death of the elder brother in the War against Italy, which coronated Charles as king leading a war torn and beaten country. The surviving dukes and counts were clearly enraged when the new king couldn't rule properly and the rest is history. Now that the king is old and dying, an heir must be choosen based on the king most loyal general"

 soxony.3b:0 "My son, as his right"
 soxony.3c:0 "A proper Roman Empire shall be ruled by a Roman General"

 soxony.5b:0 "I don't speak barbarian"

 soxony.6.test:0 "The Impotian Supremacy"
 soxony.6.desc:0 "As the Holy Italian Empire lays in ruin, the Empire of the Soxons stands stronger than ever and they have sent emissaries and priests to create more alliances and give a chance for salvation under their protection"
 soxony.6a:0 "Follow the Soxon Eagle"
 soxony.6b:0 "Do not stray from the beaten path"

 soxony.7.test:0 "The Color of the Empire"

 soxony.10b:0 "Invest in more colonial endeavours!"

 soxony.11.test:0 "Cothian Teachings"
 soxony.11.desc:0 "Since we have conquered the Goths, they have been moving all over the colonies, mainly in southern Rausulia. The problem is how profitable the gothic colonies are, but their refusal to be properly taxed has brought many headaches to our administration. They have requested full religious rights in exchange for proper taxation, but they will inevitably protest our teachings eventually"
 soxony.11a:0 "Monetary flow cannot be stopped"
 soxony.11b:0 "There are theological judges that can be sent?"

 soxony.12.test:0 "Coast to Coast"
 soxony.12.desc:0 "We have restored our borders from before the War of Reclamation, Marnesia has been beaten back and we see the Mediterranean once again. Shall we rebuild the port of Turezi or perhaps simply bask in the glory of our victory?"

 soxony.14.test:0 "A Grand Feast"
 soxony.14.desc:0 "The Emperor has always been a job of showing the power and beauty of the Empire, which translates into ensuring that any foreign emissary is well treated and respected. This is the first time so many emissaries are gathered in the halls of the Imperial Palace, so many in fact it will probably cost more to feed and house them. A great feast is usually made to showcase the Empire vast range of goods and foods, how grand the feast is usually up to the Emperor to decide"

 soxony.14c:0 "Ensure the service is impeccable"
 soxony.14d:0 "Never let them see anything out of order"
 soxony.14e: "On second though, I don't really like feasts"

 soxony.15.test:0 "Too Grand"
 soxony.15.desc:0 "The Feast has lasted much longer than expected; and the costs reflect the dire situation. The Imperial Coffers can cover most of the costs, if the coins cannot be gathered, the taxes of the capital will have to be augmented"
 soxony.15a:0 "Out of the treasury"
 soxony.15b:0 "Out of the people"

 soxony.16.test: "The Military Academies of [Root.GetName]"
 soxony.16.desc: "As the Soxon army is modernized, the need for establishing a coherent military doctrine is necessary. As that process has occured, two options for how to structure the army have emerged. On one side we could structure the army around a strong officer corp of nobles.

 soxony.17a: "Peace in our time"

 soxony.18.test: "Revoke the Acutanian Title"
 soxony.18.desc: "Acutania is a peculiar subject of Soxony. While technically a Sygirdom, it is notable less independent than the rest. There is a particular legal clause that allows us to, in times of crisis, to revoke their autonomy. However, it may burden us and it might be a better idea to leverage that clause to request support from them instead."
 soxony.18a: "Revoke Acutanian autonomy"

 soxony.20a: "They even brought a gift!"

 soxony.21.test: "[sox_rebelling_vassal_target.GetName] Declares Independence!"
 soxony.21.desc: "Our sygirdom in [sox_rebelling_vassal_target.GetName] has declared independence from the Soxon crown. We shall have to fight them if we want them back in our fold. This may not be an easy war, and we may choose to leave them be and acknowledge their independence instead"

 soxony.21b: "Let them go"

 soxony.100.test: "The Lady of Liberty"
 soxony.100.desc: "Despite everything her uncle did, Anne still wishes it didn't have to end with Soxony in flames and her family torn apart.\nBut Anne is no longer a simple princess, she has governed America fairly and justly, aided the fleeing Bretons and her navy has stopped the Norse and the Zlavs; why would the old Romon Empire be above her station?"
