#####EVENTS
 aldab.1.test:0 "Safety from Persecution"
 aldab.1.desc:0 "Many of the boats that arrive from the Iberian peninsula bring the families of Jewish citizens that fled Spaniard persecution.\nWe understand what is the peril of being of another faith than who you rule over or under, what shall we do?"
 aldab.1a:0 "Embrace our difference."
 aldab.1b:0 "Keep them to their own."

 aldab.2.test:0 "Faithful Exchanges"
 aldab.2.desc:0 "The cycles of festivities and duties between Indictians and Jewish allows many to efficiently work all week, while differences still exists, the anniversary of the arrival of our new friends is celebrated by both in joy and prayers."
 aldab.2a:0 "To Friendship!"


 aldab.3.test:0 "Abundance in Union"
 aldab.3.desc:0 "As many lives go on in the city, some arrive finding comfort in the religious freedom that the city grants to all who can participate in it's prosperity."

 aldab.4.desc:0 "All who live in this city welcome anyone that respects the faith of the other and understands that what makes one different, can also make one stronger."
 aldab.4a:0 "Embrace our difference."

 aldab.5.test:0 "The Conquest of Iberia"
 aldab.5.desc: "When the  most pious bishop of Aldabba heard of the conquest of Iberia, he wrote a letter to [Root.Monarch.GetName], detailing his desire for this freshly claimed territory. 'Iberia lays open for the taking. Rocked by religious fragmentation and warring political dynasties, each of which claim to be the last sons of the Roman Empire, the people of Hispania wallow in heresy and decadence. We shall move through Iberia like a thundering force, a holy sword that carves flesh with steel as it exices that which is unpure in the land!'\n\nMeanwhile, across the sea, the commanders of the army had a different idea for their [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. They saw this as a chance for glory, for redemption: for them, this was their opportunity to showcase how they were truly the heirs of Rome through the rite of war. They saught to launch a campaign with tens of thousands of men to reclaim the peninsula, in a grand and complete struggle for victory.\n\nThe choice presented to [Root.Monarch.GetName] was a complicated one. How should they proceed?"
 aldab.5.a: "Launch an inquisition against the heretics!"
 aldab.5.b: "Raise the banners against the pretenders!"
 aldab.5.c: "We musn't be too hasty..."
 at_least_30_provinces_iberia_in_30: "We must convert at least 30 provinces to our faith in §Y30§! Years to recieve an additional reward from the mission §YThe Hispania Campaign§!"
 must_conquer_iberia_30_years: "We must conquer all of Iberia in §Y30§! Years to recieve an additional reward from the mission §YThe Hispania Campaign§!"
 alb_converting_iberia: "The Holy Crusade"
 alb_conquering_iberia: "The Righteous Campaign"

 aldab.7.t: "The War of the Dune"
 aldab.7.d: "With a thundering roar, we descended upon the ancient lands of Aegypt. Our muskets rang as shards of iron and steel screamed through the air, tearing flesh from body in quick succession. Their riders, crushed by their own cavalry, cried out for a nurse, their God, or even their mothers, but aid would arrive. Our infantry, those brave African men, marched on, crushing and routing all who stood before them, until they reached those great monuments of Memphis, those imposing pyramids of stone. There, they celebrated and cheered - God had granted them yet another victory. These dunes have known many different rulers; the pagans of the distant past, the heretical anti-trinitarians of the 5th Century, and then, worst of all, the eastern traitors, the apostate heathen, the Rhomanoi. But now, we have done what the Red Legion could not. and we have brought the land of reeds and wheat into the care of its rightful owners.\n\nIt surprised few that the Indictians of Alexandria were the most overjoyed. They held parades on the streets, giving flowers and food to the soldiers as they marched into their quarters, some even crying at their liberation. Across the African world, the faithful were rejoicing - our brothers, once lost, have now returned. [Root.Monarch.GetName] was asked by an advisor; 'How, how is it possible that we are so blessed? That we, who have suffered so much, could see such good tidings?' The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] smiled, shrugging his shoulders. Some things were not for him to know, that he left to the almighty."
 aldab.7.a: "All things are possible through God, so jot that down."



 aldab.8.t: "Sardinians and Africans"
 aldab.8.d: "When we conquered the lands of the Sardinian princes, we were prepared to find local leaders who could barely understand our language in hopes they would smooth over the process of both the transferring of ownership and missions that the Church wished to undertake. Interestingly enough, every single person we found seemed to understand us…quite well. Our soldiers conversed with the Sardinian populace as if they were talking to Africans back home. While there was some vocabulary differences, we were not mocked or ridiculed for the short vowels, nor were we made to seem fools for pronouncing it “Bitality” instead of “Vitality”. While tensions between the conquered and their conquerors was still fraught, as it would always be, this was…a pleasant surprise, to say the least. It will at least make the integration process quick."
 aldab.8.a: "Wait...you can understand me?"
 sardinian_culture_shift_tt: "We shall move the §YSardinian Culture§! into the §YAfrican Culture Group.§!"

 aldab.9.t: "The Cloth Scheme"
 aldab.9.d: "With our recent improvement in cloth production, we have become one of the heavyweights in the industry globally. While we might not produce the most in sheer volume, we have a benefit that our production is rather cheap, and as such, with our expansion into European trade networks, we can sell our cloth against local vendors quite easily. In fact, we produce so much cheap cloth, Europe in particular has been on the recieving end of hundreds upon hundreds of shipments of some of our finest textiles, and local business have gone bust trying to compete with our low prices.\n\nThen, a scheme was hatched. With the help of a crafty merchant from the city of Aldabba, [ROOT.Monarch.GetName] implemented a scheme where after we drove the European cloth market to be completely reliant on us, we would double, nay, triple our prices! With no one to turn to, they would be forced to incur the cost by taking loans that our merchants and bankers were more than happy to offer. The scheme was set in motion, and now as they were buying the cloth..."
 aldab.9.a: "...pump it."
 cloth_scheme: "The Cloth Scheme"

 aldab.10.t: "The Cloth Crisis of [GetYear]"
 aldab.10.d: "Due to African textiles flooding the market and then their merchants increasing the price, the market has gone completely insane! In order to purchase the most basic of  textiles for our armies and civilians, let alone for high end luxury items, we have to pay nearly double or triple the price!"
 aldab.10.a: "Damn them!"

 declare_war_elector_try_to_kill_you_TT: "We shall try to force a dismantling of the Holy Italian Empire. All non-allied Electors and the Emperor will declare war on us to prevent this."
 try_to_force_emperor_ship_tt: "We shall try to become Emperor of the Holy Italian Empire and force §YIndictian§! to be its primary faith. We shall declare war on all non-allied Electors and the Emperor to enforce this."

 aldab.11.t: "The Next Campaign"
 aldab.11.d: "With the unification of the African state, our rise to power was all but assured. We conquered the squabbling Iberian states and freed the faithful trapped in cruel servitude in Egypt, showcasing our power on the world stage. But those conquests were always stepping stones towards our true goal - unifying the old Roman Empire. We are the last true heir; the Soxons and Italians follow a heretical faith filled with pagan idolatry, while the Rhomania have abandoned the faith for the heathen Arabic faith. As our generals and advisors crowd around a map of the mediterranean, we must decide on a course of action. To expand east or west would be quite the endeavor - if we are to do such a thing, we must choose to dedicate our focus entirely towards it. If we choose to move west, we shall focus on controlling and dominating Gallia, while if we choose to move east, we shall focus on breaking the remnants of Rhomania. By focusing our attention on a single campaign, we shall be able to reap the most reward from subjugating said region. Which path shall we choose?"
 aldab.11.a: "We shall campaign West."
 aldab.11.b: "We shall campaign East."
 focus_on_gallia_tt: "We shall gain additional rewards for focusing on §YGallia§!."
 focus_on_rhomania_tt: "We shall gain additional rewards for focusing on §YRhomania§!."
