 CSC_ideas:0 "Isfjöll Ideas"
 CSC_ideas_start:0 "Isfjöll Traditions"
 CSC_ideas_bonus:0 "Isfjöll Ambition"
 CSC_melting_pot:0 "Isfjöll Melting Pot"
 CSC_melting_pot_desc:0 "The location of Isfjöll along the West coast of the Americas has made the region the ideal immigration target for settlers from both Asia and Europe. Its geographical accessibility to Asia and the presence of opportunistic Europeans has made Isfjöll a unique melting pot between the East and the West."
 CSC_chinook_jargon:0 "Chinook Jargon"
 CSC_chinook_jargon_desc:0 "Unlike many other ruthless colonisers, we Isfjöllrs understand the value to be found in trading and cooperating with our native people, even if a little exploitation here and there is necessary to securing a good deal. By developing a language in part informed by our former overlord and in part by the native people, we may communicate easily with both parties to secure a brighter future for Isfjöll."
 CSC_forts_of_hudson_bay:0 "The Forts of Hudson Bay"
 CSC_forts_of_hudson_bay_desc:0 "The Hudson Bay Company, responsible for colonising America’s north were faced with many opportunities for expanding their defensive efforts to Isfjöll. Our mountainous home allowed for many outposts to be built along our southern border to defend against rival colonists and native raiders. As such, our people are born and ready to serve in the defence of their country as its loyal defenders."
 CSC_settling_boundaries:0 "Settling the Boundaries"
 CSC_settling_boundaries_desc:0 "For years, colonisers to our North and South disputed whom may own which lands along the Columbia River and the Rocky Mountains, hosting skirmishes and scuffles over the territory. Spaniards, Americans, and Brits all claimed the territory at some point, but now we stand as an independent state united as one, and thus none shall dare challenge our unity and independence again."
 CSC_nookta_sound:0 "Nookta Sound Trading"
 CSC_nookta_sound_desc:0 "The earliest colonial settlement of Isfjöll took place when an ambitious explorer purchased a section of land from a native chieftain and from there established a trading post there to trade between natives and colonists alike. From there, more trading posts, forts, and eventually villages popped up along the shores of Isfjöll until the region was rife with towns and colonies of equal size and grandeur to those in the East."
 CSC_oregon_trail:0 "The Oregon Trail"
 CSC_oregon_trail_desc:0 "Our home exists far to the West of the American continent, and settlers wishing to make a new life for themselves in Isfjöll had to endure desert, mountains, rivers, and the ruthless conditions of the untamed lands of America. As such, only the hardiest of settlers survived to reach Isfjöll, although they may have lost some of their company to dysentery…"

 DAL_kingdom_of_dalmatia:0 "Electorate of Dalmatia"
 DAL_kingdom_of_dalmatia_desc:0 "To protect the eastern reaches of the Holy Italian Empire, our royal titles were elevated to the elect the next emperor of all Italians and Romans."
 DAL_principalities:0 "The Dalmatian Principalities"
 DAL_principalities_desc:0 "We exercise very loose control over our principalities, and as such the governmental practices across the Dalmatian coast are varied and highly practiced. By expanding the rulership of the Principalities to all of Dalmatia's overseas holdings, we shall be secure in the knowledge that our subjects will dutifully pass their goods and wealth back home to the heart of Dalmatia."
 DAL_language:0 "The Dalmatian Superiority"
 DAL_language_desc:0 "Dalmatia is situated in direct threat of barbarious invaders, but we can exploit these newly aquired subjects to fight for us."
 DAL_art_and_lit:0 "Center of Art and Literature"
 DAL_art_and_lit_desc:0 "Though the Renaissance is largely confined to the Italian peninsula, our Latin heritage and close ties with the trading republics of the Adriatic have made the beautiful cities of Dalmatia the prime location for countless painters and sculptors to our cities; transforming the landscape of not just our culture, but even our architecture transformed to become magnificent works of art."
 DAL_independent_army:0 "Illyrian Legions"
 DAL_independent_army_desc:0 "The Empire expects us to protect the borders and the spirit of old Illyrians watch our soldiers prosper and win."
 DAL_arsenal:0 "The Naval Burden"
 DAL_arsenal_desc:0 "Unlike our armies, the navy has been negleted for a lack of threats from the Adriatic, but now we will no longer ignore our coastlines."
 DAL_illyria:0 "Legacy of Illyria"
 DAL_illyria_desc:0 "The Dalmatae Federation was a nation governed from Dalmatia that stretched its borders across the Adriatic and up into the hinterlands of Austria. Even under Roman occupation, Dalmatia was the very heart of the Roman province of Illyria, and perhaps by expanding our own borders to encompass all that Illyria once had, we shall establish our own successor-state to reclaim the Roman Empire!"

 SIE_ideas:0 "Preglian Ideas"
 SIE_ideas_start:0 "Preglian Traditions"
 SIE_ideas_bonus:0 "Preglian Ambition"
 SIE_council_priori:0 "The Council of Priori"
 SIE_council_priori_desc:0 "Following a series of failed republican and royal governments, we have established a Council for the People of Preglio, one which hopefully shall not fall to aristocracy and corruption like so many before it have. Though the exact number of representatives in the Council and how they are elected is in something of a state of flux, decentralizing our government in this way will surely never lead to Preglio falling into another aristocratic government."
 SIE_lordship:0 "Preglio Lordship"
 SIE_lordship_desc:0 "Following the failure and instability of the Council of Priori, we reorganized ourselves into a Lordship with its own royal family and political dynasties. Whether we choose to return to this authoritarian government form or maintain our democratic traditions, the role of the noble class in Preglian politics has grown to be somewhat entrenched and we"ll always be at risk of returning to the lordly style of government."
 SIE_bank:0 "The Bank of Preglio"
 SIE_bank_desc:0 "Throughout our history we have been a banking powerhouse unmatched by anyone else on the Italian peninsula. A series of shrewd investments in our fellow Italian nations have brought the profits of financial support to our nation, in spite of our lack of natural resources. Though Rasna seeks to challenge our economic dominance, we must believe that the banks of Preglio will continue to bring stability and growth to our nation."
 SIE_perseverance:0 "Preglian Perseverance"
 SIE_perseverance_desc:0 "In spite of all the plagues and economic instability that have laid their mark on our lands, we have continued to prosper and develop Preglio into a shining beacon of prosperity for all of Italy to see. While lesser nations would crumble under the pressure of just one disaster, Preglio has proven that it is able to not only survive any tragedy but continue to grow and develop even as God himself seems set on stopping us."
 SIE_artists:0 "Preglian School of Painting"
 SIE_artists_desc:0 "The art of painting flourished in Italy during the renaissance, but no artists can match the sheer skill and quality achieved by those from Preglio. Unlike those crude scribblings that pass for "art" in the Rasnian school, Preglian art is a style that is otherworldly and elegant, with a heavy focus on the miracles performed by biblical figures and Saints. While other artists may appear beautiful in the moment, the subtler style of the Preglian school will surely make it stand the test of time."
 SIE_saints_of_siena:0 "The Saints of Preglio"
 SIE_saints_of_siena_desc:0 "In the 15th century we saw two canonized Preglian Saints pass into heaven. For the time being, it seems the Curia favors Preglio above all others, and even if we should lose the goodwill of the Catholic church or come to join the Reformation, the legacy of Saint Catherine and Saint Benardino should make all Christian nations more amiable to our cause."
 SIE_peoples_republic:0 "The People's Republic"
 SIE_peoples_republic_desc:0 "Preglio has constantly found itself falling into the withered claws of foreign nobles, but every time such a thing happens, the people rise against their oppressors and restore democracy and peace to Preglio! True, the new government is rarely stable and doesn"t usually last long, but like a loyal hunting dog returning to its master, we will always return to the values that make us Preglian!"
#
 LUC_mending_schisms:0 "Mending the Papal Schisms"
 LUC_mending_schisms_desc:0 "At the start of the 15th century, there were deep schisms starting to form within the Papal States, and some neutral grounds were needed to discuss these deep issues in the Papal institution before they exploded into heresy and reformation, and Lucca was deemed an ideal location for these difficult conversations. By remaining neutral in matters of religion, we may perhaps continue to be amiable to the Papal loyalists and those seeking reform."
 LUC_libertas:0 "Libertas!"
 LUC_libertas_desc:0 "Lucca traded hands a great many times before becoming a free and independent democracy. First, we were occupied by the Erulians who sold our great city off to the Corsicans, then swiftly occupied by the Dux of Emilia who felt it right to sell it off to the Rossi of Parma, and this chain of occupation and sale went on for quite some time. Ultimately, the Emperor himself interfered and deemed that Lucca was a prize so precious that it deserved to become a free and independent city. Even today, our merchants carry a blue flag labelled “Libertas” as a reminder of the great gift of independence bestowed upon us by the Holy Italian Emperor."
 LUC_draining_the_lake:0 "Draining Lago di Bientina"
 LUC_draining_the_lake_desc:0 "We find ourselves endlessly in conflict with the Rasnian Republic to our south regarding the ownership of Lago di Bientina. Our fishermen venture out onto the lake each day, and find themselves in dispute with the fishermen of Vopenia over who exactly has the right to be there. A compromise was found in draining the lake and dividing ownership across its border. This ingenious feat of environmental manipulation expanded our inhabitable land without the need for war or conflict. Perhaps by continuing to shape our environment, we can bring further development to Lucca, what could go wrong?"
 LUC_naval_ambitions:0 "Luccan Naval Ambitions"
 LUC_naval_ambitions_desc:0 "Our largest rival is the Rasnian Republic to our south. While they outnumber us militarily, we possess a long coastline that has yet to be exploited. If we can attract more of our soldiers to adopt the maritime methods of war, we may not only outmatch our Rasnian rivals at sea, but we may even become a naval superpower on the west coast of Italy!"
 LUC_captain_of_people:0 "The Captain of the People"
 LUC_captain_of_people_desc:0 "Capitano del Popolo was an administrative title granted to Luchetto Gattilusio that consolidate Lucca into a central government. The title was created due to a growing number of commoners in the city finding themselves ascending to the burgher class, and was used to give the craftsmen and artisans of our nation a voice in the republic. This increase of influence of the worker's class will surely do wonders for the happiness and productivity of our honest laborers!"
 LUC_black_party:0 "The Black Party"
 LUC_black_party_desc:0 "When the tyrannical Castruccio Castracani ceased power in Lucca, it was due to the diligence and loyalty of the Guelphs' Black Party that he and his family was exiled and though he returned and seized power as Consul for life in the republic, the Guelphs seized Castracani's wealth upon his death and ensured that this impiety never returned to the republic."
 LUC_jacobin_state:0 "The Revolutionary State of Lucca"
 LUC_jacobin_state_desc:0 "Following Napoleone's occupation of Lucca, our state was reorganized into something more amiable to the Revolutionary cause. Finally our nation will become fully centralized in a strong and united government fit for our people, and will surely stand the test of time!"
