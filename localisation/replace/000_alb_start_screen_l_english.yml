alb_starting_string_generic: "The greater European world in [GetYear] is on the verge of the §YAge of Discovery§!, finally pulling away from the centuries of stagnation that have preceded this momentous era.\n\nIn Italia, the §YHoly Italian Empire§! reigns, however decentralized. It shall face many challenges ahead, though.\n\nIn the east, the §YRhoman§! eagle still soars over the near east, but it has now been joined by the Islamic crescent. As militant crusaders from the §YRed Legion§! prepare for the §R4th Crusade§!, who knows what shall become of the lands of the Levant.\n\nIn Gallia, the empire of §YSoxony§! faces it's greatest crisis yet, with the various §YSygirdoms§! struggling against the chafing grip of the aging emperor.\n\nIn the Germania, the §YSwardians§! continue to centralize the confederation while the eagle of §YSaxony§! prepares for the great eastern Crusade against the heathens of Turan.\n\nIn the far east of Europe, where the civilized world meets the wild steppes, lies the sons of Guo Hong. The Empire of 10,000 Armies left quite the mark on Eastern Europe, with §YSiescheng§!, the crown jewel, at it's heart. The entire continent is on the verge of major changes, and it will be up to you to lead the §Y[Root.GetAdjective]§! [Root.GovernmentName] through this Aevum Lupi Bicipitis."

string_start_biono_generic: "The Norse peoples of Biono fled their homes in §YZladinia§! a thousand years ago, believing that the end of the world, Ragnarok, had come. In the flight their gods perished, but upon their landing on the verdant shores of Biono they found new ones. Chief among them is §YBaldr§!, son of Odin and the resurrected Lord of Light.\nThey have made new kingdoms, §YSweden§!, §YJutland§!, and more, some of which have fallen to the proselytization of the Christians. However more still stay true to their roots, finding true faith in Baldr.\n\nIn the north of Biono lies a perculiar entity, the §YGanden Union§!. An equal partnership between 4 petty duchies, united in the city of Ganden in 1302. It is not without infighting, but has stood the test of time and looks to be on a path of further centralization. Fully united, they will be a powerful nation indeed.\n\nMoving away from the Norse, the §YBrittanians§! stand as the last remnant of Roman rule in Biono. Formerly united with the kingdom of §YJutland§!, they are on a losing streak and are preparing for a final confrontation with the Swedish which shall determint the fate of Biono.\n\nJust across the pond, the isle of §YScotia§! lies divided. The kingdom of §YScotland§! stands as the almost-supreme ruler of the isle, if not for the meddling §YBelgians§!. Their kingdom has fallen to piracy after the untimely death of the former king. The question now is who shall take the place as hegemon of Biono. Will it fall to Norse ambition, will the Brittanians reclaim their birthright, or shall the Celts drive out the invaders?"

string_start_danubia_haemia_generic: "600 years ago, greater §YDanubia§! fell under the control of the §YAvar Khaganate§!. When the §YBavarians§! and their allies in §YGermania§! crushed the Avars at the battle of Ostrava in 903, the Khaganate crumbled in a matter of years, and the tribes of Danubia could breathe free once again. But much has changed since then.\n\n §YAvaria§!, once the undisputed rulers of Danubia, has been reduced to nothing more than a rump state left barely clinging to life. They have recently lost yet another war to §YGepidia§!, a splinter of the §YSaxon Order§! sent to pacify the region on behalf of the Saxon King.\n\nTo the east lies §YDacia§!, long Europe’s shield against the barbarian invaders of the steppe. It was thanks to them that Guo Hong’s armies never crossed the Carpathians. Beyond them is §YSawark§!, once shock troops in the army of the §Y10,000 Armies§!, now the only true Turks remaining west of the Dnieper.\n\nThe last Windelics of Danubia have held firm in §YJuggowindera§! for generations, putting the Dacians in their place when they saw fit to leave their mountain homes. But with the Saxon invasion of Avaria the Windelics are caught between three powers, and only time will tell if the Windelic dream will survive.\n\nIn western Danubia, the Latins of §YPannonia§! have long served as the shield of the §YHoly Italian Empire§!, the wall on which the §YLongobards §!and §YRimedaxians§! were broken. But Imperial support has been waning for generations, and Pannonia barely fended off a Longobard invasion in 1438. They have entered uncharted territory, but they aren’t content with going down without a fight.\n\nSouth of Danubia lies the lands of §YHaemia§!. After the West fell the region was briefly under the control of the §YRhomans§!, until the Ugric invasions in the 11th century drove them out completely, pushing them back to Constantinople and resulting in a raid on the city by the Estonians in 1031.\n\nThe Ugric tribes would coalesce into the §YKolmejary Confederation§! in 1205, establishing total control over Haemia for another hundred years, until their conversion to Christianity triggered the crisis of the 14th Century and their power was crippled. By 1444 the Confederation has mitigated the worst of the Crisis with the Edict of Zetulii, but with rumors of Rhoman weakness they have begun setting their sights on the east.\n\nTo the west of the Kolmejars is the §YMagyars§! and §YAustrians§!, who broke free from the Kolmejar yoke in 1311, and together fended off an Italian invasion in 1324. They have steadfastly maintained their independence from the Latins and Kolmejars ever since. The Habsburg and Hunyadi dynasties have long been intertwined, and some have even discussed establishing a union like the Kolmejars did.\n\nIn the south stand §YCumania§! and §YTurkey§!. The Turks first arrived in Hellas as auxiliaries in the Rhoman army and settled in the region when the Byzantines retreated in the face of the Ugric invasions. Cumania is still reeling from the War of the Horselords a decade prior, and the Turks are turning increasingly to the Holy Italian Empire out of fear of Rhomania returning."

string_start_urals_generic: "East of §YTuran§! lie the §YUral Mountains§!. They were long thought to be an impenetrable wall, a barrier against foreign invasion that would either slow down their enemies long enough to organize a response, or prevent them from attacking in the first place.  They were wrong. The §YWindelics§! soon found that out the hard way, §YGuo Hong’s§! armies marching through the Urals as if they were nothing more than ant mounds in their path west.\nThe lands around the §YAtilon§! river have always been a diverse land. It became a haven for the §YOghuz§! and §YKipchak§! tribes that fled west in the face of the §YSerbian§! invasion. Much later, it became a haven for many of Guo Hong’s inner circle who weren’t content with following madmen like §YDuoluo§! or pushovers like §YFu Chen§!. By 1444 power within Atilon has coalesced into three different clans that have risen to greater prominence in the century the failure of the §YMarch of the 10,000§!: The §OHengelder§! clan, the §OAstan§! clan, and the §OSeljuk clan§!, who represent Guo Hong’s soldiers, the Kipchak tribes, and the Oghuz tribes respectively. While a relative peace has existed between the clans since the reorganization of the realm following the failures of the March, tensions have begun to rise to a fever pitch. The Hengelders believe the best path forward is towards the restoration of the Empire of 10,000 Armies. The Astans and Seljuks disagree, considering the Empire to be long dead and well beyond the point of saving. A civil war was only narrowly avoided two years ago when the Hengelders were convinced to lay down their arms, but it’s only a matter of time before the fragile balance of power shatters.\nNestled between §YGajnaka§! and §YAtilon§! lies the Sultanate of §YStanbal§!. Stanbal made a name for itself a century ago by being the place where renowned Islamic scholar §YOsman Bey§! took up residence. While in the city of Mekali he formalized radical theories on the topic of Alevi Islam, taking syncretism with the traditional Turkic beliefs further than even some of the most devoted Olisanis. After his death, the residents of the city renamed it to §YOsmanabat§! in his honor. But all would not be well for the Osman family. During the March of the 10,000, Osman’s son, Orhan, rallied the people of Stanbal to the side of the Restorationists. Orhan was killed at §YTorzhok§!, however, and upon returning to Stanbal his son Murad was driven into exile as punishment for the failure of his father. Stanbal’s weakness in the wake of the March gave the Emirate of §YBeydurn§! the perfect opportunity to strike. By 1444 Stanbal has become a shadow of its former self, left to wait for death in three directions."

string_start_turan_generic: "Hundreds of years ago the land now called§Y Turan§! was known as the land of the Rus’. When Attila’s Huns ravaged across the east, the §YWindelics§! fled to §YZladania§!, and a new people came to take their place: §YThe Turks§!. The region experienced a relative era of peace until §YGuo Hong§! once again ravaged the area. With his death, Turan has been left more divided than ever, with the sons of his former generals vying for power and those who suffered under his rule hellbent on preventing it from ever returning.\nThe Sultanate of §YGajnaka§! was once the preeminent power in Turan, until Guo Hong’s invasion changed everything. They were reduced to a shadow of what they once were, clinging to life in the periphery of their former territory. With Guo Hong’s death, however, they were able to reclaim much of their former glory, ushering in a new golden age. But all that came into question when the §YMarch of the 10,000§! began. As city after city began to fall, they were forced to turn to an unlikely ally for help: The §YValteans§!. Together with their new allies they managed to beat back the Restorationists at the §OBattle of Torzhok§!, ending the threat of the Empire once and for all. It seemed that peace could finally return, but it was not meant to be. Rising tensions culminated in §YSultan Adil Honogly§! being assassinated by Valtean spies in 1429. A succession crisis followed, plunging the realm into a bitter decade long civil war from which they have only recently begun to recover from. By 1444 Adil’s youngest son, §YBatir§!, has barely emerged victorious. The realm is on the edge of oblivion, and one mistake could send it over the cliff.\nSouthern Turan has been brought under the control of the §YUnion of Cathay§!, the army with what can passingly resemble a state. Their former general, §OMad General Duoluo§! of the Dahe clan, died unexpectedly in 1336. His young son §YMohui§! took the reins in his stead. He rallied the §YFive Armies of Guo Hong§! under his banner in 1337 and launched the '§YMarch of 10,000§!'. The campaign was initially a success, with each victory over their enemies leading more and more allies to flock to their banners. But fate had other plans in mind. The Restorationist forces were crushed by the armies of Gajnaka and Valtea at the battle of Torzhok. Mohui was killed by a stray arrow in the retreat that followed, and any hope of unity died with him. Without a leader to rally around the Armies splintered and the First Army was driven out of Gajnaka entirely. It seemed like Guo Hong’s Empire would be dead for good. But with Gajnaka in crisis, the time may come for the first army to march again."

string_start_latveria_generic: "The lands of §YLatveria§! were given a name 200 years ago, when the various chiefs of the §YLithuanian, Latvian, and Prusijan§! tribes met in the city of §YVilnius§! and formalized a union: The §YGrand Duchy of Latveria§!. The state served as a buffer against the §YTurks§!, preventing them from moving into Europe. But the Grand Duchy was beset with crippling internal defects and petty squabbles that §YGuo Hong§! was more than eager to take advantage of. The Duchy was shattered by his armies, and Latveria was forever divided.\nThe §YBaltic§! power seen by many, and especially themselves, as the successor to the Grand Duchy is the Kingdom of §YLitvia§!.  Ruled by the §YPalemonid§! dynasty since the fall of the Grand Duchy, Litvia managed to maintain their independence from the Saxons thanks to guarantees from §YValtea§!. In 1356 they sent out couriers to §YVurozia§! and §YLavija§! for a potential reunification of the Grand Duchy, but it wasn’t even dignified with a response. While trade with §YSiescheng§! has made them rich, and protection from Valtea has kept them safe, King §YAntanas§! knows history must be made, not waited for, and that can only be done through action.\n§YVurozia§! has long been the black sheep of the Baltic family. They were the last to arrive in Vilnius when the Grand Duchy was founded, and they were the first to leave as it crumbled. Of course, this didn’t save them from Guo Hong’s wrath, and they were conquered all the same. Since the fall of the Empire Vurozia has found themselves boxed in by enemies. Many of their brothers languish under the §YSaxon§! bootheel, the Litvians cling to nostalgia from the only time they were relevant, and the Turks raid them incessantly. But the §YPrusijans§! refuse to be swept away by history. In recent years, rhetoric from Vurozia has grown increasingly belligerent, and their society has grown more and more militarized. They have laid claim to §YYedisan§!, as it was part of the '§YPrusijan March§!' under the Grand Duchy and have already engaged in skirmishes with Suomeya. History is written by the victors, and Vurozia is tired of losing.\nWhat is now §YLavija§! is but a fraction of what they once were. The Lavijan march once stretched to the §YTuranian§! frontier, but those days are long gone. Lavija has, for many years, existed as an act of charity from Valtea, who have prevented Litvian invasions and protected them from §YTatar§! raids on many occasions. But they aren’t foolish. They’re aware that Valtea simply seeks to undermine them and eventually integrate them. The only question is, how much longer will they be able to prevent it? With §YGajnaka§! in crisis and the Tatars distracted internally, Lavija will either reclaim their destiny, or die in obscurity.\nThe city of §YSiescheng§! was once an irrelevant village in rural Latveria. Guo Hong liked the location and had it flattened, building a grand capital for his empire in its place. After his death the city would be ruled by his son, §YGuo Song§!, alongside the §YCouncil of Masters§!, handpicked by Guo Hong for their loyalty. Guo Song would oversee an era of relative peace and stability, ensuring the chaos of their neighbors would not breach their walls. But his son, §YGuo Huang§!, however, grew bored of peace. He attempted on several occasions to seize territory around the city and bring it into the fold, only to be stopped by the Council, who had grown wary of allowing any one man to rule a city with a million inhabitants. They began plotting a coup in the shadows to remove him. But when the §YMarch of 10,000§! began, Guo Huang wanted to march the army in support of the Restorationists. It was the perfect excuse to be rid of him. Guo Huang was overthrown, and the Council declared themselves the supreme authority over the city. But in the face of the §YSaxon§!s, it may only be a matter of time before the §YPearl of the East§! becomes another jewel in the Saxon crown.\nThe city of §YSavastia§! was founded by a regiment of Guo Hong’s soldiers in the days after his death, as the Empire began to crumble. It became a haven for those seeking to start new lives after the fall of the Empire, proving to be one of the most western-facing states in greater §YTuran§!. When the March of 10,000 began, the old guard of the city decided to stand behind §YMohui§! and joined the §YUnion§!. But when the March failed, they had lost the support of the people. They were forced to step down from their posts, and Savastia drew much closer to Rhomania than to any of the other remnants. Since then, they have lost all interest in restoring the Empire, choosing instead to turn to matters of religion and peace.\nThe §YTatars of Dardaria§! were unruly even when they followed Guo Hong. One of Guo Hong’s old friends, §YJin Wang§!, was made their general, and was able to put forward some sense of discipline among the 'barbarian soldiers'. After the Empire fell, he kept his post by killing a dissenter in front of his men in single combat.  He had proven himself with strength. But Jin Wang made a gamble when he joined the March, and he failed. He was weak. His men overthrew him before he even made it back to the capital and elected a veteran soldier as their new Khan. They’ve just gotten worse since them, fully embracing the moniker of 'barbarian savages'. All the while, Jin Wang’s son§Y Cao§! languishes in §YDi§!, waiting for the perfect opportunity to return home and reclaim what was taken from him."

string_start_krimina_generic: "The lands of §YKrimina§! are a lush, bountiful steppe. An enticing place to settle for any would-be nomad looking for a spot to graze their horses. And incredibly easy to subjugate. That was to be the fate of Krimina, total subjugation by §YGuo Hong’s§! relentless armies. But the people were resilient, and they outlasted him and his empire. Now, the people of Krimina are free to assert their own destinies or die trying.\nTo say that §YSuomeya§! was conquered by Guo Hong would be a misinterpretation of what really happened. The territory might have been occupied by his forces, and they may have vanished from the map, but the Suomeyans never gave up. From the moment the §YEmpire of 10,000 Armies§! first marched into Suomeya they took to the wilds of the steppe, launching lightning raids on Guo Hong’s men week after week, month after month, for years on end. And they didn’t stop fighting until the last §YTurk§! had left their soil. Their reputation alone prevented the §YUnion of Five Armies§! from even attempting to encroach upon them in the March of 10,000 Armies. Despite their recent clashes with the §YVurozia§! over Suomeyan settlements across the Dnieper, the Suomeyans stand uncontested as the most fearsome state in Krimina.\nThe trade networks of the §YAuxinos Sea§! have long been entirely dominated by §YGreek§! merchant guilds, the strongest being the §YMetole League§!. Their modern territory was once part of the Empire of 10,000 Armies, but following Guo Hong’s death the area was seized by mercenaries in league with the guild. The territory was jointly administered by both the Metole League itself as well as §YRhoman§! administrators, until the §YEdict of Xilya§! in 1304 granted them independence, so long as they paid a yearly tribute to the Rhoman court. The League has since grown to incorporate the city state of §YKunnaga§!, ruled by powerful Suomeyan merchants.\nThe §YDi Confederacy§! is the last remaining remnant of Guo Hong’s influence within Krimina. It came to be in the dying days of the Union of Five Armies, when General §YHuan Fu§! declared his intent to break from the Union and return home. The §YSecond Army§! of Guo Hong reorganized itself into a Confederation, albeit with their general’s family in charge. The §YDi§! themselves were once feared raiders until their subjugation by Guo Hong. The §YFu§! clan emerged as the most influential of the Di clans, and §YChen Fu§! was appointed general of the Second Army for his loyalty. The Confederacy was once one of the strongest powers in the region, but constant raids by §YCircassians§!, §YSuomeyans§!, and §YTocharians§! have left them crippled for years.\nThe tribe of §YKuchiya§! are a proud people constantly beaten back by fate. Many years ago, the length of the §YRiver Yik§! was theirs, until the §YSamoyeds of Kanmazia§! drove them, and by extension the §YAlaskans§!, south. Since then, Kuchiya has limped along, putting forth a façade of strength to keep outsiders at bay. Constant raids against their neighbors have kept them safe, but it’s only a matter of time before the mask slips, and they have made many enemies who would love nothing more than to rip it off. "

string_start_tag_south_east_asia: "The 15th century was a time of turbulence in §YCherosyne§! and §YSuwarnadvipa§!, which saw many great empire fell, while many states rose. Without Emperor of §YJongwa§!  to enrich the empire of the region, The Empire of §YAngkor§! and §YSrivijiaya§! fractured into several successor states. Amidst the ash, the §YCham§! of Champa and §YMaule§! of Swarnadvipa forge their little kingdoms with blade, ousting the old governor from far-off and fallen empires.\nAcross the vast ocean lie the isle of §YNusantara§!  and §YPanyupaya§! , stuck in eternal feud to gain control of Southern Jongwa shore now that Jongwa is disunited once more. While nominally disunited, the regional thalassocracy such as §YTondo§!  of Panyupaya or §YJenggala§!  of Nusantara proclaim themselves as protector of their regional trading vessel and monopolize large part of the taxes. However, the dissolution of their rival mainland empires presented a larger headach to them as their shore are now besieged by Cham pirate who have established their haven in §YPalembang§!  and §YKauthara§! .\nThe periphery of mainland isn't spared from the fate that befallen Angkor, in-fact their fate have already been sealed when Jongwa fractured. Without a power to contain them, the southern barbarians gazed upon not only the splendid cities of Jongwa, but also the impressive pagoda valley of Pyu and flourishing delta of Irrawaddy.
