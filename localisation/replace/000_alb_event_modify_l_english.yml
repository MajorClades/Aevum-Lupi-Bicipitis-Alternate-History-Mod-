The words echoed across the halls of St. Peters Basilica as Pope [PAP.Monarch.GetName] proclaimed Imperium Sub Pontifexus, the Empire under the Pope. The reaction across the Catholic world has been of both shock and recognition, with kings and emperors alike crying out at the 'attempted violation of soveriegnty'. \nMany have rallied around the Pope, proclaiming a new kingdom of God has risen. Most others have rallied around the Emperor, arguing that the Pope's place is not one of a king."

 aow_events.1.d:0 "All of [Root.Owner.GetName] suffers in war, but those provinces which lie in the path of the enemy suffer worst. What appears to a soldier or commander as a convenient source of supplies is often all the common people have. The outskirts of [Root.GetCapitalName] have been plundered in this war to the point of starvation. They are now reaching out for the government to aid them in recovering, lest the suffering of [Root.Owner.GetName] drag on for years past the eventual peace."
