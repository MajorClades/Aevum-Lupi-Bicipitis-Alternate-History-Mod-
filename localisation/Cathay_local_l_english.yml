#####EVENTS
 catha.1.test:0 "The Preparations"
 catha.1.desc:0 "An attempt at restoring the Dragon Empire was taken by our predecessor with just about five of the most loyal armies, but we were defeated by a coalition of traitors. As war is on the horizon and the soldiers are preparing outside the walls, rumors are spreading among the peasantry and lesser nobility. The Builders Guild seem to be opposed to collaborating with [Monarch.GetName], citing the necessary work that would need to be done with roads and the high probability that they would not be paid."
 catha.1a:0 "The Guild sends its regards."
 catha.1b:0 "Third time's the charm."

 catha.2.test:0 "Call Upon The Loyalists"

 catha.3.test:0 "In Need of a little Faith"
 catha.3.desc:0 "The diverse faithfuls that make up our dominion have maintained a somewhat stable peace, but we must ensure that eventual conquests do not make this diversity into a greater problem.

 catha.3b:0 "We remain faithful to our roots."

 catha.4.test:0 "The Southern Frontier"
