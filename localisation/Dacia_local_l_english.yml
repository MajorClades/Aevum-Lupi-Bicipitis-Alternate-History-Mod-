#####EVENTS

 dac.1.t:0 "Taking the Castle"
 dac.1.d:0 "For centuries barbarians have taken Jidava as their ruined fortress, between Avars and Windelics, there is little left of the original structure. However this has not stopped bandits from striking those unaware of the fort conditions."
 dac.1a:0 "There is little we can do."
 dac.1b:0 "Send someone to guard the roads."

 dac.2.t:0 "The Duke of the Castle"
 dac.2.d:0 "Several individuals have come up with a permanent solution to the problem of Jidava and its bandits: Mathias Aelucard, a young Gepid noble of Dacian descent, is the illegitimate heir to the last owner of the land near Jidava and therefore the owner of the castle; The Illyrian duke of Belmondo, Raffaele, who previously bought the land, even if they never lived in it.\n\nWhoever will liberate the fort will legally own it as subjects under the Dacian crown. However, the mercenary company of the '500 Companions' have offered to simply clear the castle and guard it while we keep the newly freed land."
 dac.2a:0 "Duke Mathias Aelucard, welcome back."
 dac.2b:0 "Belmondo's claim is fresher."
 dac.2c:0 "The Mercenaries are easier to handle."

 dac.3.t:0 "The Duel of the Dukes"
 dac.3.d:0 "Despite a brief collaboration by the two claimants, after the liberation of the Castle, a duel was issued and our presence requested.\nBelmondo challenged the german Aelucard for the full ownership of Jidava to put an end to the apperently long-standing feud between the two noble houses.\nThe duel will commence after dinner and many nobles will be present to ensure the fight doesn't end in an even worse rivarly."
 dac.3a:0 "Mathias wins!"
 dac.3b:0 "Raffaele wins!"

 dac.4.t:0 "The Stakes are High"
 dac.4.d:0 "In spite of Mathias' victory, a man cries out from the cheering crowd. Abraham vo Waskaszyja, a lesser noble and bounty hunter, has followed the adventous Aelucard from all over northern Europe to settle some debts the newly made duke had aquired in Saxangle, of which he now stand to face trial in that kingdom.\nWe could pay the debt and gain the undying loyalty of the duke or we could send him back to pay his dues."
 dac.4a:0 "We will pay what is due."
 dac.4b:0 "Let the sucker go."

 dac.5.t:0 "The Restored Aegis"
 dac.5.d:0 "The walls could be renovated and the gate made anew, Jidava will see glorious days, but to be rebuilt on modern standards would cost quite a lot. If done corretly Jidava will stand as the best defensive fort this side of the Carpathian mountains."
 dac.5a:0 "It is worth the cost!"
 dac.5b:0 "Easy the peasantry's worries."

 dac.6.t:0 "Protection for Loyalty"
 dac.6.d:0 "The Dacian Kingdom asks for our submission to them in exchange for protection."
 dac.6a:0 "Fine."
 dac.6b:0 "No."

 dac.7.t:0 "Cut from different Cloth"
 dac.7.d:0 "The normal training for professional troops make them far superior to any militia, and the Falx regiments make any professional army look like illiterate peasants.\nHowever their cost and their efficiency has been called into question, could we achieve the same result by spending less or should we make them train less to allow for more troops?"
 dac.7a:0 "Less training but more trained."
 dac.7b:0 "Worse equipment but more training."

 dac.8.t:0 "The City of World's Desire"
 dac.8.d:0 "The city stands as the Marble of the Rhomanian Empire and now its ours.\nWe will take good care of her and her people, but we could secure the city will not fall into rebellion by simply replace some of the population with our own?"
 dac.8a:0 "This will be Our New Capital!"
 dac.8b:0 "Respect the Citizens."

 dac.9.t:0 "Imperial Goals"
 dac.9.d:0 "Like the Roman Empire of old and new, our conquest has brought more enemies at our borders, but we will not stop. We will continue to expand regardless of how many barbarians there are and eventually there will be no borders to defend."
 dac.9a:0 "The Land of the Old Empire."
 dac.9b:0 "A New Empire of Dacians."

 dac.10.t:0 "Fate of the Gepids"
 dac.10.d:0 "Our recently conquered Gepid subjects have become increasingly unruly. A series of solutions of how to deal with them have been presented, ranging from granting them their own vassal state to outright settling the land with loyal subjects from our core lands."
 dac.10a:0 "Grant them autonomy."
 dac.10b:0 "Settle the land with slavs."
 dac.10c:0 "Settle the land with Avars."
 dac.10d:0 "Settle the land with loyal Dacians."

 dac.11.t:0 "A Frightful Night"
 dac.11.d:0 "The peasants of [4127.GetName] speak of a monster stalking them through the nightly walks and many maidens have been reported disappering.\nThe local superstitions of blood-sucking demons has lead them to accuse the lord of the city, Count Orlok, to be a creature of the night and therefore guilty of the disappearances. The Count, according to other local nobles, does have bizzare habits: dine far too late in the night and very pale skin; this, however, does not make a man guilty of heinous crimes, but mass appeasament could benefit the crown."
 dac.11a:0 "Send the Count somewhere else."
 dac.11b:0 "I'm sure we can solve this diplomatically."
