 cef_alaska.2.d: "The peoples of Alaska strive to break free from the shackles of colonial rule and carve their destiny in the icy wilderness of the North. In the midst of imperial power struggles and geopolitical upheavals, an opportunity arises for Alaska to grasp its independence through shrewd negotiation and strategic maneuvering. An option has arised - if we can muster a massive sum of money we could possibly gain independence through the power of the coin instead of the bloodshed of war."

 cef_alaska.3.t: "A Letter from the Colonies"
 cef_alaska.3.d: "n a surprising turn of events, delegates of [Root.GetName] find themselves presented with an unprecedented offer from the distant colony of Alaska: a proposal to purchase its independence from it's colonial overlords. The proposition, brought forth by Alaskan representatives, carries with it the weight of both opportunity and complexity. As news of this offer spreads, it sparks intense debate and deliberation among [Root.GetAdjective] leaders. The prospect of gaining such a large sum of cash is tantalizing. Yet, questions abound regarding the feasibility, implications, and consequences of such a transaction."
 cef_alaska.3a: "They may have their independence"
 cef_alaska.3b: "What a pitiful offer! Never!"

 cef_alaska.1.t: "Expedition to Siberia"
 cef_alaska.1.d: "In a bold endeavor to expand trade and strengthen diplomatic ties, [Root.GetName] sets its sights across the vast expanse of the Bering Strait, contemplating the launch of a pioneering expedition to Siberia. The proposal, championed by visionary leaders and intrepid explorers, promises to open a lucrative trade route linking the two continents and fostering greater cooperation between nations. As preparations for the Siberian Expedition commence, excitement and anticipation ripple throughout [Root.GetName]. The prospect of establishing direct trade connections with Siberian markets, rich in resources and opportunities, fuels the aspirations of merchants, adventurers, and policymakers alike. However, embarking on such an ambitious venture entails formidable challenges and risks. Navigating the treacherous waters of the Bering Strait, braving the harsh Arctic conditions, and overcoming logistical hurdles pose significant obstacles to the success of the expedition. Furthermore, diplomatic negotiations with Siberian authorities and indigenous peoples demand delicate diplomacy and tact."

 cef_alaska.4.t: "A Letter from Siberia"
 cef_alaska.4.ta: "Following a daring voyage across the Bering Strait, the [Root.GetAdjective] expedition finds itself on the shores of Siberia, a land of vast wilderness and untapped potential. As the pioneers explore this new territory, they are surprised to encounter representatives from the distant realm of [owner_of_siberian_province.GetName], whose presence signals the beginning of a diplomatic exchange fraught with opportunity and challenge. Amidst the pristine landscapes of Siberia, the [Root.GetAdjective] expedition and [owner_of_siberian_province.GetAdjective] emissaries engage in tentative but cordial interactions. Despite initial differences in culture, language, and customs, both parties recognize the potential benefits of establishing trade and fostering good relations. The prospect of forging a trade route between Alaska and Siberia holds promise for mutual prosperity and cooperation. Resource-rich Siberia offers valuable commodities such as furs, timber, and minerals, while Alaska boasts unique goods coveted by [owner_of_siberian_province.GetAdjective] markets. Through careful negotiation and diplomacy, the foundations of a lucrative economic partnership begin to take shape."
 cef_alaska.4.tb: "After braving the perils of the Bering Strait and traversing the vast expanse of Siberia, the [Root.Getname] expedition arrives on the shores of a land shrouded in mystery. However, their expectations of encountering established civilizations or centralized authority are shattered as they discover a landscape largely untouched by outside influence. Faced with this unforeseen reality, the expedition is presented with a unique opportunity—to establish their own colony in this uncharted territory. As the pioneers survey the pristine wilderness of Siberia, the allure of founding a new settlement takes root. The absence of centralized authority and the untapped potential of the land beckon ambitious adventurers, settlers, and entrepreneurs. With the blessings of their homeland and the dreams of a brighter future, they begin laying the foundations of what will soon become New [Root.Getname]."
