 flavor_ya0.d.1:0 "Thundering hooves ring out across the steppe as the Yakut tribesmen ride towards our camp. Their leader, the "Toyon" as he is called, dismounts his horse and holds out his arms to greet our envoy. He explains that he has led his people on a long journey, from the distant east, in search of greener pastures to settle down on.\nThe Toyon believes he has found the perfect place to settle his people: in the grasslands of Läklentas. As rulers of the area, he has offered his warriors to aid us in military service, so long as we allow his people to rule the land autonomously. Yet as he speaks, his face hardens and he steps forward solemnly. He adds a warning before departing: He cannot, and will not, turn his people back now. It seems that if we do not accept his terms, we will have to face him in battle."

 flavor_ya0.1.b:0 "Savages! Drive them from our land!"
