#Events
 rakl.1.test:0 "Raklionne Dominance over the Straits"
 rakl.1.desc:0 "With little celebration, the last Maurian holdouts along the Pillars of Hercules fell, and our dominance was assured. This move has increased our flow of revenue greatly and it has reached us that a change in trade policy is necessary. With our hegemony over anything entering or leaving the middle sea, we can either choose to pursue a policy of long-term gains or immediately raise the tariffs."
 rakl.1a:0 "Go for the safe move."
 rakl.1b:0 "I like money!"

 rakl.2.test:0 "Vandalic Brotherhood"
 rakl.2.desc:0 "The island of Melita stands as another remnant of the great Vandalic kingdom which once ruled much of Africa and Iberia. As we both share heritage, they have welcomed our rule and much cultural interchange has occured between our lands."
 rakl.2a:0 "Ok."

 rakl.3.test:0 "Chartering the Sardich Kompanie"
 rakl.3.desc:0 "Our nation has always had a large prescence in Sardinian ports, whether formally or informally. It was not a huge step, then, to launch a total conquest of the island. A group of merchants has actually become particularly interested in the island, actually, and wishes to set up an extraction-focused company on the island."
 rakl.3a:0 "To Sardinia we go!"
 rakl.3b:0 "Why would I ever want to go to Sardinia?"

A growing idea of a unified identity, the people of the straits of Herkules, finding themselves in communion with each other more than outsiders. From this unified identity we will forge a nation out of the straits, a truly Herkulean nation."
