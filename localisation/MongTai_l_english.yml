 TH8_decision_title:0 "Form Mueang Tai"
 TH8_decision_desc:0 "This land was once foreign to our ancestors but we have made it our own. Here we have built a new society where Tai influences have met local ancient Mon traditions. We have our own language, our own administrative traditions and our own myths and legends. It is time we show the world that the south has overcome its differences and is united as one."
