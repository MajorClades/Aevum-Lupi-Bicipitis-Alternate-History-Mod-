 pann.1.t:0 "The Illyrian Compromise"
 pann.1.d:0 "The Dalmatians and the Pannonians have always been in an unspoken rivalry but many times they have set aside their differences to defend eachother, while that may not have worked in the past against Romans and other invaders. We have the opportunity to secure the Pannonian grain, no longer having to rely on the Empire, by lending some of our soldiers to protect them against the Longobards and perhaps a more formal alliance."

 pann.1b:0 "We can rely on the Empire."

 pann.2.t:0 "Deal Or Not Deal"
 pann.2.d:0 "The Dalmatians have come with a proposal for our grain exports in exchange for troops and easy access to their coastline, but this will undoubtedly bind us closer to them while they hold our rightful land. Perhaps it could be beneficial for a time while we prepare to break them later on."

 pann.7.t:0 "The Proclamation of Greatness"

 pann.7b:0 "All are Welcomed in Our Fields."
