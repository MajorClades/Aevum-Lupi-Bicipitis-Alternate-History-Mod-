 alb_indonesia_event.1.t: "Legacy of Wijaya"
 alb_indonesia_event.1.d: "The drums of Majapahit once rolled across the archipelago like distant thunder. From the rice fields of Java to the jade waters of Melaka, all knew the name of Raden Wijaya, the Thunder King—the man who repelled the Melayu, forged a realm from chaos, and declared an empire by divine right.\nBut the golden lotus withers. His line is broken, his realms divided, and the title is no more. Warlords rise like mushrooms after rain. Brothers raise blades against brothers. Ministers whisper of omens and forgotten debts.\nWhat was once a mandala of cosmic order is now a mist of conflicts.In the shadow of Raden Wijaya’s legacy, each petty king claims the right to wear the Kshatriya crown. Yet none hold the keris with his will, nor walk with the light of his dharma.And yet... the fire may still smolder in the ash.The sacred tamarind still grows. The old oaths linger in stone and blood.\nWill a new Thunder King rise from the ruin? Or will Majapahit pass into legend, its glory swallowed by jungle and sea?"
 alb_indonesia_event.1.a: "Our roar shall be thunderous."
 
 alb_indonesia_event.2.t: "Breaking Good"
 alb_indonesia_event.2.d: "You summoned them to settle a dispute. A noble merchant from Parthia, Azat-Karag, and the alchemist, Vahram-Asavazd—both valuable, both dangerous, both staring daggers across the hall.\nAzat speaks first. Calm, precise yet his words goes against his manner.\n“If he ever disrespects me again, I will erase his lineage. I will hang his sons by their scholar’s robes. I will bury his wife’s tongue in a salt jar. I will burn his home so thoroughly, even the ashes will flee.”\nVahram steps forward, trembling not with fear, but fury barely contained.\n“You think I’m in danger? No. I am the danger. The one who knocks. The fire that turns saltpeter to thunder.”\nA gasp ripples through the chamber. The silence after feels heavier than any war drum.\nThese men are not merely subjects. They are tiger and lion.\nAnd your court can only have one."

 alb_indonesia_event.3.t: "The Wind and The Word"
 alb_indonesia_event.3.d: "For generations, we have adhered the creed of dharma — the sacred balance that flows from Siva, Buddha, and the ancestors who guard the land and sea.\nFrom the shores of Sumatra to the temples of Java and Bali, the candi, prasasti, and palm-leaf manuscripts tell of a world shaped by the kawi tongue, sacred geometry, and the ancient law of harmony.\nBut now, new winds reach our ports.\nForeign traders speak of a single god, born into the world as a man, crucified and risen. Others whisper of the Prophet Mani, whose teachings describe a universe divided between Light and Darkness, bound in the bodies of men.\nTheir scrolls are strange, yet elegant. Their rituals are unfamiliar, yet resonate with our belief. Some layfolks listen. Some temples begin to mix the old prayers with new ones.\nIn the harbors, the world is changing. The gods of the inland may not remain unchallenged.\nThe court now debates: will we remain as guardians of the old dharma, or shall we open our hearts to a new vision of truth?."
