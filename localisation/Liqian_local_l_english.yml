 liqian.1.t: "Fall of the Mingjiao Rebels"
 liqian.1.d: "The Ming state was the creation of the bandit lord Deng Peng, a criminal turned Manichean convert that leveraged his connections to rebel against the opressive governance of Bo Duoli. It was an illegal and illegitimate state that held no future when met with our legions. And now, the Manicheans which so desperately wanted their freedom shall once again know our heel."

 liqian.3.t: "Heirs of Rome"
 liqian.3.d: "Before Bo Duoli took power in Guangdong, the region consisted of a series of princedoms and merchant-lords, centered around Guangzhou. Duoli, a general-turned-warlord from the northern regions, brought order and stability to the land - but along with this peace, he brought strange ideas. A claim to an ancient legacy, of a great and ancient kingdom only showing up in old records and books. That of the heritage of Daqin. Specifically, he claims to be a descendent of a lost heir, captured by the barbarians and settled in Gansu.\n \nWhen he took over Guangdong, he renamed it Liqian, in reference to his supposed hometown of Old Liqian, which had been burned down by Guo Hong. Additionally, he claims it refers to the regiment his supposed ancestor commanded before their capture and enslavement. The people have accepted this strange pretending, at the expense of Liqian being the laughing-stock of all of China."
